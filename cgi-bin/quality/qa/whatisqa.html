<title>SEDL Staff - Product Quality - QA - What is QA?</title>

<!--#include virtual="/staff/includes/header.txt"-->

<h3><br>What is Quality Assurance (QA)?</h3>
<P>
To ensure the highest possible quality of its work and substantive products, SEDL has had a 
formal Quality Assurance (QA) system in operation since 1991.  The QA system is periodically 
evaluated and has evolved over the past ten years as a result of both evaluative feedback and 
the requirements enumerated in three different Regional Educaitonal Laboratory (REL) RFPs from 
the Institute of Educational Sciences (IES)*.  The current system involves multiple reviews of REL products and services at 
three different stages in their development.  Responsibility for the QA system has been 
assigned to SEDL's Evaluation Services (ES) unit, and the system is facilitated by an 
ES staff member.  
<P>
* Formerly the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI)
<P>
<H3>What needs to go through QA?</H3>
<P>
All major products and services produced by the REL and intended for an external 
audience are subject to QA review.  In addition, some products intended for 
internal use at SEDL (e.g., evaluation reports and research designs) will also be reviewed.  
<P>
General categories of products to be reviewed include:
  <UL>
  <LI>Research designs and reports
  <LI>Other reports and papers (e.g., synthesis papers and evaluation reports)
  <LI>Training designs and materials
  <LI>Serial publications (e.g., regularly published newsletters or bulletins)
  <LI>Data gathering instruments, tools, toolkits, and portfolios
  <LI>Conference designs and materials
  <LI>Video and audio tapes
  <LI>Electronic products (e.g., CD-ROMs and WWW pages)
  </UL>
<P>
The following products are exempt from the QA process:  
  <UL>
  <LI>Products published by another organization
  <LI>Papers and presentations at invitational conferences
  <LI>Progress reports and updated annual plans
  <LI>Non-major publications
  </UL>
<P>              
            
 <H3>What criteria are used to guide the review process?</H3>
<P>
See <a href="/staff/quality/qa/criteria.html">QA Review Criteria</A>. 
<P>

<H3>When do products get reviewed?</H3>
<P>
Products are reviewed at three different points in the development process:  
	<OL>
	<LI>the conceptual stage,</LI>
	<LI>the early draft stage, and</LI>
	<LI>the completed draft stage.</LI>
	</OL>
The review process may be repeated at any of these three points if either the developer(s) 
or reviewer(s) feel that multiple reviews would be beneficial.
<P>
<B><I>Conceptual stage</I></B><BR>
The first stage review focuses on the plan for developing the proposed product.  Developers 
provide reviewers with a description of how they envision the product, its intended 
audience and purpose, and general ideas about how they plan to develop it.  At this stage, 
a strong priority is placed on eliciting feedback from reviewers about the need for the 
product in SEDL's region, its potential utility, its appropriateness for the intended 
audience, and whether it properly reflects the overall goals of REL work.  
<P>
<B><I>Early draft stage</I></B><BR>
The <B><I>early draft stage</I></B> review will provide reviewers with a first look 
at the general design and content of the product.  Issues to discuss at this point may 
include whether the design will achieve the intended purpose of the product, audience 
appropriateness, usability, intended outcomes and how they will be met, and 
dissemination strategies.
<P>
<B><I>Completed draft stage</I></B><BR>
The third-stage review gives internal and external reviewers the opportunity to 
assess whether all of the proposed components of 
the product have been fully developed.  Primary considerations for the review at 
this point will include the product's overall quality and usability, 
its overall coherence and fit with existing work in the area, and 
whether it has been developed in a way that will achieve its intended outcomes.
<P>

<H3>Who reviews products?</H3>
<P>
There are three different  types of reviews in the current system:  
1) external, 
2) internal team, and 
3) Chief Operating Officer (COO).
<P>
<B><I>External</I></B><BR>
The two primary sources for external reviewers are (1) technical/subject-area experts and 
(2) practitioners or representatives of the intended audience for products.  External reviewers are 
remunerated for their services and are asked to participate in reviewing a product 
or service at different stages in the research, development, and dissemination (RD&D) process.  
Products may be reviewed externally by individuals, expert panels, or focus groups, 
depending on the appropriateness of each of these approaches for a particular product 
and the timing of the review.  
<P>
<B><I>Internal team</I></B><BR>
Internal peer review teams are composed of REL programmatic and evaluation staff members 
in program associate and specialist positions and senior staff members at the Dana Center 
who are involved in collaborative work with SEDL.  A team of three staff members will be 
assigned, and the same internal team will participate in reviewing a product throughout the 
various stages of its development.
<P>
<B><I>Chief operating officer</I></B><BR>
SEDL's executive vice president and chief operating officer serves as the third source of 
product reviews in the QA system.  
<P>

<H3>How do I request a QA review?</H3>
<P>
Program managers oversee the work of developing REL products and initiate the 
review process at particular stages of product design and development.  To 
request an internal review, developers must provide the QA coordinator with a 
copy of the product to be reviewed and a completed 
<a href="/staff/quality/qa/qa-reviewrequest.doc">QA Review Request Form</A> 
signed by their manager.  
The manager's signature on this form indicates that he or she has reviewed the 
product and believes it is ready for QA review.  The QA coordinator will then 
make copies of the product and deliver them to the internal review team and to 
the COO.  External reviews are arranged and facilitated directly by the managers.
<P>

<H3>Then what happens?</H3>
<P>
For the internal team review at the conceptual and early draft stages, 
team members review the product individually, then meet as a group to decide what 
feedback to provide to the developer(s).  The team leader then schedules a time 
for team reviewers and developer(s) to meet and discuss the product.  The COO 
also reviews the product at these stages and provides independent feedback to 
the developer(s).  At the completed draft stage, the same procedures are followed 
except that the developer(s), the team reviewers, and the COO all meet together 
to discuss the product.  Managers and developers will make arrangements for 
external reviewers to provide feedback directly to them.       
<P>

<H3>What's a team leader?</H3>
<P>
The first time that an internal review team is assigned to review a product, 
team members decide among themselves who will be the team leader for all 
reviews of that product.  The team leader is responsible for scheduling 
discussion meetings, facilitating discussions among reviewers and between 
reviewers and developers, and documenting review team feedback (see 
<a href="/staff/quality/qa/database.html">QA Documentation Database</A>).
<P>

<H3>What happens if the reviewers and the developers don't agree?</H3>
<P>
If a serious disagreement arises between product developers and reviewers that cannot 
be worked out, you should contact the QA coordinator. The 
issue will be referred to SEDL's president and chief executive officer.   
<P>

<H3>Who should I talk to if I have problems with QA?</H3>
<P>
Any questions or problems that arise concerning the QA system should be discussed with 
the QA coordinator.
<P>
 
<H3>How is review feedback documented?</H3>
<P>
Internal teams and the COO should provide a written description of the feedback 
given on products.  Feedback from the 
team reviews will be recorded by the person chosen as team leader for each 
product review, and the COO will document feedback from her review.  
The information is to be entered into the 
<a href="/staff/quality/qa/database.html">QA Documentation Database</A>.  
There are two parts to the form on the database.  Part I should be completed 
PRIOR to the product feedback meeting with developers and reviewers.  Part II 
should be filled out following the feedback meeting.  A hard copy of the completed form 
(both parts I and II) should be provided to the QA coordinator by the review team leader.
<P>
Program developers should provide a copy of the external review feedback 
to the QA coordinator for documentation purposes.  Developers shall also 
complete the Developer Response to QA Feedback (on the QA Documentation Database) 
and provide a hard copy to the QA coordinator.
