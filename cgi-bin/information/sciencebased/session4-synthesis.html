The synthesizers produced the         following final version of the Session IV synthesis, which is organized         by question.</p>      <p><b>Question 1: Does the Session III synthesis accurately reflect your         group&#146;s August 1 discussion? If not, what would you change?</b></p>      <p>Most groups thought the synthesis was an accurate reflection of their         August 1 group work, though one group felt the summary would be better         thought of as an aggregation rather than a reflection of group discussion.         In addition to including the results from the SECAC summary of Session         III, the following changes were suggested:</p>      <ul>        <li> Add a point about using theory to drive SEDL&#146;s work (under Question           3, last bullet).</li>        <li> Add a point about creating an operational definition of scientifically           based research, including a continuum of the trustworthiness of evidence,           to clarify the operational definition (under Question 3, first bullet).</li>        <li> Add value systems as an example of a source of bias (under Question           1, second bullet).</li>        <li> Note that not all groups thought the six guiding principles needed           additional clarification.</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 2: Does the refined Session II-III synthesis accurately reflect         your group&#146;s discussions? If not, what would you change?</b></p>      <p>Again, most groups thought that their discussion was accurately represented         in the refined synthesis, with the following suggested changes:</p>      <ul>        <li> Make the point about the importance of understanding the theoretical           bases of our work more of a central issue than a peripheral one (under           Question 2, first bullet).</li>        <li> Add a question about defining the meaning of &#147;empirical&#148;           in Principle 1 (under Question 1).</li>        <li> Add a statement under Principle 6 (under Question 1) that the disclosure           of information about a scientific inquiry not wait until the end of           the investigation but be ongoing throughout the inquiry process.</li>        <li> Note that some groups thought the principles should be applied in           linear fashion, while others disagreed; also note that such application           can be complex.</li>      </ul>      <p>Question 3: The consensus position is that SEDL adopt and apply to our         work the guiding principles of scientific inquiry included in Scientific         Research in Education. You said, however, that these principles needed         to be further clarified and made more explicit before we could apply them         to our work. The refined synthesis document (see Question 1) lists the         questions you raised around the six principles&#151;pick those principles         (at least three) about which your group has the greatest concern and address         the questions posed under those principles by either answering them or         proposing ways in which they could be answered (be specific and concrete).<a href="#page_up">         [ UP ]</a></p>      <p>The synthesis of the group responses to this question is presented by         principle, with the set of questions to be addressed in the discussion         immediately following (in italics) the stated principle. Looking across         the six groups of participants, the number of groups that addressed each         principle is as follows:</p>      <p>Principle 1: 3 <br>        Principle 4: 1<br>        Principle 2: 3 <br>        Principle 5: 3<br>        Principle 3: 5 <br>        Principle 6: 4</p>      <p><i>Principle 1: Pose significant questions that can be investigated empirically</i><br>        What does &#147;significant&#148; mean? Is it the same as &#147;important?&#148;         Does it mean &#147;complex&#148; as opposed to &#147;simple?&#148; For         SEDL, would the application of this principle mean that there must be         a strong connection to education practice?</p>      <p>A significant question has the following characteristics, which can be         used to guide the selection of research questions that SEDL addresses:</p>      <ul>        <li> Possesses a clear application in SEDL&#146;s six focus areas of work</li>        <li> Possesses a clear, practical, timely, and direct application to improving           student learning</li>        <li> Addresses a problem that is non-trivial, widespread, and persistent           in SEDL&#146;s region</li>        <li> Provides an opportunity to create new knowledge or fill an existing           gap in knowledge</li>        <li> Is within SEDL&#146;s capacity to adequately address it</li>      </ul>      <p><i>Principle 2: Link research to relevant theory</i><br>        What does &#147;relevant&#148; mean? Again, for SEDL to apply this principle,         would it mean there must be a strong connection to a theory of practice?</p>      <p>Theories are stable explanations of phenomena that generalize beyond         particular cases. Theories can be tested, measured, observed, and linked         to others&#146; theories&#151;not just to personal ideas and beliefs.         SEDL does need a common understanding of the term &#147;relevant&#148;         and the strength of its connection to theories of practice.</p>      <p>A relevant theory:</p>      <ul>        <li> has an overarching theoretical framework that researchers make explicit           and within which hypotheses are posed.</li>        <li> can be used to predict practice, so theory is connected to practice           and can be operationalized in the field.</li>      </ul>      <p>In terms of practice, the researcher:</p>      <ul>        <li> Must make choices in terms of competing theories.</li>        <li> Can review the literature as one way of developing both research           questions and relevant theory.</li>        <li> Doesn&#146;t ask questions just to collect facts, but rather links           questions back to the theoretical framework that drives the scientific           inquiry.</li>        <li> Will find it challenging to develop and test theory at the same time,           as in the case of the REL &#147;cube theory.&#148; </li>      </ul>      <p><i>Principle 3: Use methods that permit direct investigation of the question</i><br>        What does &#147;direct investigation&#148; mean? Do the constraints of         resources (funding, time, people) impact the selection of methods? If         so, how do they and what do we say about those constraints? How does the         quantitative-qualitative distinction relate to this principle? Under what         circumstances can descriptive methods be counted as scientific? Is there         a continuum of the trustworthiness of evidence that is related to the         methods employed to gather it (e.g., from anecdotal to experimental manipulation)?         If so, what is it? <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></p>      <ul>        <li> Direct investigation means explicitly delineating a logical chain           of reasoning that links the research question to the method used to           investigate it (see Principle 4); and the direct link between method           and question allows you to develop this chain of reasoning. Direct investigation           also implies a sense of efficiency.</li>        <li> Descriptive methods are scientific when reliable data collection           methods are used (e.g., instruments and observation results are reliable,           procedures are systematic).</li>        <li> SEDL should adopt a process that encourages more input by staff and           external experts to develop its research design and methods; systems           need to be in place to ensure that the data being collected are valid.</li>        <li> SEDL is constrained by a lack of resources but could partner with           others to investigate a question (this could also serve as a strategy           for dealing with replication).</li>        <li> SEDL should develop a statement supporting the implementation of           well-designed qualitative research in addition to quantitative research.</li>        <li> Professional development sessions are needed to help staff address           issues concerning research methods.</li>        <li> Both exploratory and confirmatory research are important&#151;if           little is known about a particular construct, it may not only be appropriate,           but necessary, to first conduct case studies or use other qualitative           methods. Whether a method is scientific does not have to do with whether           it is qualitative versus quantitative; it has to do with the extent           to which the method is employed in a manner that is systematic and replicable.</li>        <li> Establishing QA teams to provide feedback at the research design           stage would help generate feedback and discuss the bias that might be           established by the fact that non-representative sites or participants           may be selected for research due to lack of resources to reach other           sites/participants.</li>        <li> Direct investigation is most likely to occur when people have been           engaged in the research design and have sought feedback on whether their           methods permit the construct of interest to be examined in an appropriate,           valid, and reliable way.</li>      </ul>      <p><i>Principle 4: Provide coherent, explicit chain of reasoning</i><br>        To what does this apply (e.g., the connections between question, evidence,         and conclusion; the connections between findings, implications, and applications)?</p>      <ul>        <li> The degree of coherent, explicit reasoning affects all elements of           a research strategy.</li>        <li> The extent to which a researcher carries out the research design           faithfully affects the quality, results, and coherence of the research.</li>        <li> A continuum of trustworthiness exists across the range of scientifically           based research approaches and findings.</li>      </ul>      <p><i>Principle 5: Replicate and generalize across studies</i><br>        How does the notion of converging evidence relate to this principle? What         is the role of contextual factors in dealing with replication?</p>      <ul>        <li> Homogeneous, well-defined target audiences of students often do not           exclusively constitute research samples, and this can affect one&#146;s           ability to use the research findings.</li>        <li> Contextual variables in research studies may not fit or match the           perceived importance of those variables as they are related to SEDL&#146;s           work.</li>        <li> Generalizability from research findings is enhanced by the size and           diversity of the sample.</li>        <li> SEDL&#146;s integrated research and development approach makes replication           difficult, if not impossible.</li>        <li> SEDL staff need skills to select and review scholarly research literature           and to synthesize research results appropriately across multiple studies.</li>        <li> Researchers, trainers, and technical assistance providers at SEDL           should have a common understanding of research principles and findings           from current research. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></li>      </ul>      <p><i>Principle 6: Disclose research to encourage professional scrutiny         and critique</i><br>        How do ethics fit in this principle? Does this principle adequately capture         the notion of the social construction of knowledge? Does this principle         entail explicitly stating all of the potential sources of bias involved         in conducting a scientific inquiry (e.g., political agendas, theoretical         camps, chains of reasoning, selection of methods, the sponsor&#146;s charge         for the work)? In professional scrutiny, who counts as a peer?</p>      <ul>        <li> Review of an inquiry process should include continuing professional           scrutiny and critique throughout its execution.</li>        <li> Peer review can and should be used to identify and reduce bias.</li>        <li> The &#147;beneficiaries&#148; of SEDL&#146;s research could be useful           and effective reviewers in critiquing the research process as it unfolds.</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 4: You made a number of recommendations concerning how SEDL         should attend to scientific research, and the quality (or rigor) of it,         in our work (see Question 2). Select the recommendations (at least three)         deemed most critical by your group and discuss what would have to be done         to act on them (be specific and concrete).</b></p>      <p>Below are the synthesized responses groups made around the discussed         recommendations (stated in italics); the number in parentheses after each         bullet represents the number of groups that addressed the particular recommendation.</p>      <p><b>Bullet 1: Theoretical bases</b> (discussed by 2 groups)<br>        SEDL should be explicit about the theoretical bases of our work and should         conduct institution-wide discussions to strengthen our collective understanding         of those theoretical bases (as well as the specifics of the work itself),         focusing in particular on our current core work in </p>      <ul>        <li> Improving school performance</li>        <li> Strengthening teaching and learning in content areas</li>        <li> Integrating technology into teaching and learning</li>        <li> Involving family and community in student learning</li>        <li> Connecting disability research to practice</li>        <li> Supporting policy development through research</li>      </ul>      <p> Create study groups that meet regularly to read, discuss, and critique         emerging research in our six institutional focus areas.</p>      <p><b>Bullet 2: Securing funding</b> (1 group)<br>        SEDL should develop complete programs of RD&amp;D through these theoretical         bases and become more proactive in securing funding (both federal and         non-federal) to support and sustain those programs of work. </p>      <ul>        <li> We recommend that SEDL provide institutional support to develop and           secure additional funding and utilize the variety of skills that SEDL           staff can bring to the table. This support includes providing incentives,           support for proposal writing, and, in some cases, adjustments to indirect           cost charges for specific proposals.</li>        <li> After reviewing SEDL materials for conformance with the scientific           research principles, a marketing effort could generate additional funds           by repackaging those materials to better fit within the NCLBA requirements.</li>        <li> An ongoing program of RD&amp;D should utilize work already performed,           replicate research, and not start anew with every new program. We should           build on past work and strengths. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></li>      </ul>      <p><b>Bullet 3: Review of current work</b> (2 groups)<br>        SEDL should review its current work to determine the extent to which it         is aligned with the principles of scientific research, including our approach         to professional development, our approach to working with schools and         practitioners, and our current research and evaluation projects. SEDL         should take steps to bring its work into alignment with these principles.       </p>      <ul>        <li> Group members discussed the relevance of reviewing our current work           if we cannot change our methods midstream to align with the principles.           Some suggested our time would be better spent preparing for future contracts/work.           Others said we might draw better conclusions for our current work using           these principles even if we could not change our methods to adhere to           them.</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Bullet 4: Quality assurance process</b> (4 groups)<br>        The quality assurance process should apply the principles of scientifically         based research in its review parameters, should become institution wide,         and should begin at the conception of projects. </p>      <ul>        <li> The QA process should be reviewed and adjusted to ensure that the           scientific research principles are appropriately incorporated into the           review criteria; a cross-institutional task force could take this task           on.</li>        <li> To increase the quality of our work and our research methods, we           would like the opportunity to receive feedback from others regarding           our research questions and research design. We think that the QA process           is a natural mechanism for this, although we think it would be helpful           to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of the QA process, and to           reorganize the structure and scope of QA so that it would be possible           to get feedback at the conception of projects. Once the QA process has           been examined and improved, we would like the process to be institution           wide.</li>        <li> SEDL should promote and support with time and resources the publication           of its research in refereed journals, including listing these articles           as deliverables in its proposals.</li>        <li> SEDL should continue and expand the REL writing teams, which were           formed to write articles on specific topics for journal submissions,           to include staff from other programs/projects.</li>        <li> SEDL should allocate 5 percent to 10 percent of staff time to develop           journal articles. Allow staff to work at home if they are working on           articles.</li>        <li> Staff should convene program teams to plan topics for articles and           determine who will write them, to what publications they will be submitted,           and timelines for completion.</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Bullet 7: Professional development </b>(3 groups)<br>        To increase staff understanding, SEDL should support an ongoing dialogue         between those who work primarily with assisting practitioners and those         who work primarily in conducting research. Ongoing professional development         should be provided in research methods and research practice, with differing         amounts and depths. </p>      <ul>        <li> Offer professional development cross-lab as well as in individual           work groups to build research skills and understanding.</li>        <li> Survey staff regarding their current level of knowledge and understanding           about research methods and research practice to guide the development           of pertinent questions. Perhaps Evaluation Services could help with           the survey task. Survey results could be used to develop job-embedded           professional development, including within-program group discussions.</li>        <li> Create a user-friendly summary of research methods with associated           strengths and weaknesses of each.</li>        <li> Develop a connection and ongoing feedback loop between fieldwork           and research. This can be accomplished through creating more opportunities           for researchers to understand the perspective of the fieldwork and for           practitioners to learn how to approach their work as applied researchers.           There needs to be more explicit discussion between researchers and practitioners           about how their work can be integrated and reciprocally informative.</li>        <li> Need to train Task 1 site staff to think of themselves as researchers.           There needs to be more discussion to help clarify roles. Staff need           opportunities to discuss how to have the self-consciousness required           to take on different roles at different times, which is not easy to           do.</li>        <li> Share information across sites. There is a serious issue of isolation           among site staff in the Task 1 work. For example, the small-group meetings           for Task 1 staff are divided by state, and since the small-group meetings           are one of the main opportunities for the Task 1 staff to share their           work, this arrangement really precludes sharing across many of the sites.</li>        <li> SEDL might benefit from a knowledge management system that would           allow staff to easily use key words to examine work done by SEDL staff.           However, before a knowledge management system would be used, staff must           be motivated and have buy-in that they would benefit from knowing more           about others&#146; work. We think this buy-in and interest in looking           for knowledge could be built by providing structured mechanisms for           people to meet more frequently with one another to share challenges           and solutions/tips.</li>        <li> Continue the process we have been using (that is, a systematic one           planned around topics of priority to staff), employing both cross-institutional           small-group and large-group work.</li>        <li> The QA teams should have representation of perspectives from both           those who work primarily with assisting practitioners and those who           work primarily in conducting research. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></li>      </ul>      <p><b>Bullet 11: Research community connections</b> (1 group)</p>      <p>SEDL should be better connected to the research community.</p>      <ul>        <li> Connect SEDL to the research community&#151;make connections with           university and other individuals, inviting them to make presentations           and provide professional development. </li>        <li>Miscellaneous (based on recommendations provided through 2 groups)           <ul>            <li> We need to be &#147;field&#148; driven and not &#147;federal               funds&#148; driven.</li>            <li> We need to be identified around significant issues or arenas               (i.e., important questions).</li>            <li> We need to develop a reputation as an important research center               as well as a products and services organization (D&amp;D).</li>            <li> We need to develop research-based products, tools, and resources               that can be successfully transferred to the field.</li>            <li> We need to become much more than a research institution. We need               to become an institution that has the capacity to do research on               and about educational practices and contribute both original knowledge               and practical strategies based on and validated by research. This               is the niche that no one fills. It means working significantly differently               than a research institution like RAND. </li>            <li> We need to engage in theory in the field.</li>          </ul>        </li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 5: You listed a number of other types of knowledge that SEDL         needed to pay attention to as a producer and consumer of scientific research         (see Question 3). Select those types of knowledge deemed most important         by your group, define them (being clear about how they differ from scientific         knowledge), and discuss what would have to be done to better act on those         types of knowledge (in combination with scientific knowledge) in SEDL&#146;s         work (be specific and concrete).</b></p>      <p>Most groups did not have sufficient time to address this question; the         three groups that did reported the following:</p>      <ul>        <li> The list is a mixture of both content and types of knowledge, and           their definitions are not clear.</li>        <li> Practical knowledge, knowledge from best practice, and conventional           wisdom are probably the same; with professional knowledge being that           derived from &#147;doing&#148; coupled with knowledge acquired through           reading and study.</li>        <li> The most important types of other knowledge are professional knowledge,           contextual knowledge, and knowledge of human interactions.</li>        <li> SEDL should develop a process to obtain implementation information           from practitioners, using it along with the guiding principles of scientific           inquiry.</li>        <li> SEDL staff need to have competencies to conduct field observations. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a>        </li>      </ul>      <p><a href="http://www.sedl.org/staff/information/sciencebased/">Resource         Archive: Scientific Research in SEDL's Work</a></p>      <!--#include virtual="/staff/includes/footer.txt"-->
