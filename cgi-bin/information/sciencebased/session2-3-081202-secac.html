Subgroups addressed the questions first and the whole-group         discussion followed. We agree with many of the points made in the synthesized         report. Following are comments SECAC would add: </p>      <h4>Session II </h4>      <p><b>Question 1: Are the six principles given in the NRC report adequate         for defining scientific research in education? If not, how do you think         they need to be modified? </b></p>      <p>In general SECAC supports the principles of scientific research. A primary         concern is how SECAC could better assist its clients in the application         of scientific research practices, strategies, etc., in the context of         the six principles. </p>      <p><b>Question 2: Given your group’s definition, how do you think SEDL should         attend to scientific research and the quality (rigor) of it? What would         we need to do differently to act on scientific research in the manner         you recommend? </b></p>      <p>As a group, we need to learn what scientifically based research means         and how to apply it to our work. Use future staff meetings to discuss         strategies on using the principles in our work. Learn how to use the principles         when assisting clients in a way that does not make us “talking heads.”         Make presentations in a language that the client will understand. Create         “process questions” to use when working with clients. </p>      <p><b>Question 3: To be a successful RD&D institution, where success is         defined in terms of our ability to build knowledge and bring it to bear         on practice, are there other types of knowledge that we need to pay attention         to beyond that which comes from scientific research? If so, what are they,         how well do we attend to them, and what would we do in order to better         act on them? </b> </p>      <p>Other types of knowledge we need are: </p>      <ul>        <li> Marketing theory </li>        <li> Change theory </li>        <li> Adult learning </li>        <li> School culture/anthropology </li>      </ul>      <p>We need to be able to: </p>      <ul>        <li> Help teachers to move scientific knowledge into practical application         </li>        <li> Integrate lots of areas when working with schools. Use the team approach           to maximize staff strengths. </li>      </ul>      <h4>Session III </h4>      <p>Again, SECAC engaged in this session at its retreat. SECAC used a different         set of questions for this discussion. The primary reason was that in our         role of working in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Education,         we believe we will have a major responsibility in assisting schools and         school districts in implementing many USDE programs, e.g., Reading First.         Therefore, our discussion centered on understanding the National Reading         Panel (NRP) report and its structure and limitations as well as its implications         in our work. Following are answers to the questions subsumed from our         discussion. </p>      <p> <b>Question 1: What did you learn from this session’s readings that         changed your understanding of scientific research in education? </b></p>      <p>There is a gap that separates researchers from practitioners. All research         involves a trust factor. </p>      <p><b>Question 2: Did this particular case lead you to change your thoughts         about any of the principles in defining scientific research you felt were         important from your position in Session II? If so, how? </b></p>      <p>This particular case seems to be narrow in its focus, particularly because         of the type of research it is&#151;a meta-analysis. There are also many         other types of research that are scientific that the NRP did not consider         when establishing its criteria for inclusion in the analysis. </p>      <p><b>Question 3: Would you change your responses to any of the other questions         you addressed in the previous session concerning SEDL’s attention to scientific         research and other sources of knowledge based on your discussion in this         session? If so, what changes would you make? </b></p>      <p>This question was not addressed in our discussion. </p>      <p><b>Question 4: Does the Session II synthesis accurately reflect your         group’s discussion? </b></p>      <p>For the most part it does. Because SECAC addressed Session II after the         synthesis was posted, we had the opportunity to compare our responses         to the other responses from Session II. Points of departure were noted.       </p>      <p><b>Question 5: Do you want to continue the dialogue on scientifically         based research via a listserv or a bulletin board? </b></p>      <p>SECAC recognized the need to continue in face-to-face discussions. Because         we are geographically distant from SEDL, comparing what we think as a         unit to what other integrated groups think is important, but we would         not replace the face-to-face discussions. </p>      <p><b>Additional notes from the discussion: </b></p>      <p>The NRP report is identified as scientific research, but we recognize         that this research is inherently value-laden. To accept it as scientific         research, you have to buy into the criteria that the NRP established to         include a study in its meta-analysis. If the criteria are accepted, then         the subsequent analysis and conclusions make sense. If the criteria are         viewed as too narrow a focus, or dismissed, then there are lots of questions         about the report. </p>      <p><a href="http://www.sedl.org/staff/information/sciencebased/">Resource         Archive: Scientific Research in SEDL's Work</a></p>      <!--#include virtual="/staff/includes/footer.txt"-->
