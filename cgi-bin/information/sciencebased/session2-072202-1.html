If not, how do you think         they need to be modified? </b></p>      <p>Group 1 agreed that the six principles are adequate for defining scientific         research in education. Group 1 acknowledged that the principles are stated         in vague terms and that there is a lot of room for interpretation and         implementation. We also discussed the order of the principles. Although         the authors of the book observe that the principles may fall in any order,         there was discussion that principle No. 2 (Link Research to Relevant Theory)         might best come before principle No. 1 (Pose Significant Questions That         Can Be Investigated Empirically) in order to strengthen the theoretical         strands of our research. There was consideration of the idea that SEDL's         research could be better centered around a theoretical framework, rather         than the federal government establishing the parameters of our work. We         considered the implications of not continuing SEDL's research from one         five-year contract to the next. </p>      <p>The group also discussed the iterative and "messy" nature of the six         principles and of scientific research&#151;e.g., researchers often change         their line of questioning after making certain discoveries or finding         anomalies. It was observed that the principles are often adhered to not         so much in the planning and execution stage of research but afterward,         when the researchers are writing up the work. </p>      <p>Further discussion centered on the idea that research is a socially constructed         activity. The six principles do not adequately invoke the participation         of the larger research community. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></p>      <p><b>Question 2: Given your group's definition, how do you think SEDL should         attend to scientific research, and the quality (or rigor) of it, in our         work? What would we need to do differently in order to act on scientific         research in the manner you recommend? </b></p>      <p>We approached this question by considering each of the six principles         and evaluating how well SEDL is doing in relation to each. We only had         time to discuss the first few principles. </p>      <p>With regard to the first two principles, there seemed to be a consensus         that SEDL's research lacks a strong theoretical basis. One group member         observed that in the current REL work, it is difficult to determine whether         we are testing theory or asking questions. Again, the issue arose that         because of the nature of our federal grants, we seem to be following the         grant money instead of following theory. In other words, there is a political         agenda that influences SEDL's work. </p>      <p>With regard to the principle of replicating and generalizing the research,         we discussed the fact that replicating REL work seems impossible during         our five-year contract. We discussed concerns that practitioners often         do not seem to value research. One member observed that one reason for         this could be that in education research, there seems to be research to         support almost any point of view; another member mentioned the bottom-line         mentality for schools and districts. </p>      <p>To strengthen SEDL's research, we recommended SEDL staff: </p>      <ul>        <li> Take the six principles into consideration for all of our programs.           Our work should be linked more closely to theoretical framework; this           includes our use of research in development and dissemination as well           as in conducting research. This framework should be tied to our institutional           mission, which relates to our constituents and to the practical application           of theoretical framework. </li>        <li> Have institutional-wide discussions around relevant theory, with           specific institution members responsible for this and making certain           that SEDL staff members understand the relevant theory and connect it           to their work. </li>        <li> Connect with relevant theorists in different ways (e.g., invite them           to visit SEDL, make presentations to the organization); connect with           the national educational community. </li>        <li>Take a more stringent approach in formulating hypotheses, objectives,           and benchmarks. We often define success in terms of the activities completed;           activities should not constitute meeting a goal, but contribute toward           accomplishing our goals. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 3: To be a successful RD&D institution, where success is         defined in terms of our ability to build knowledge and bring it to bear         on practice, are there other types of knowledge that we need to pay attention         to beyond that which comes from scientific research? If so what are they,         how well do you think we attend to them, and what would we need to do         in order to better act on them? </b></p>      <p>Group 1 agreed that the other types of knowledge relevant to our RD&D         institution: practitioner knowledge and community needs and values (this         includes policy structures in place that heavily influence values, e.g.,         the TAAS or TEKS). We discussed that we must involve practitioners from         the beginning of our work if it is going to be meaningful to them in the         end, and we must establish a symbiotic relationship with them&#151;practitioners         are most important to us in our work and we must develop the type of relationship         so they see the importance of educational RD&D in their lives. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></p>      <a name="group2">       <h4>Group 2</h4>      </a>       <p><b>Group members present:</b> Sean Claes, Johanna Franke (recorder),         Ashley Galaway, Cori Groth, Wes Hoover, Kim Hughes, Ann Neeley, Vangie         Orozco, Joe Parker (reporter), Cindy Schneider (facilitator), Sue Street         (synthesizer) </p>      <p><b>Question 1: Are the six principles given in the NRC report adequate         for defining the scientific research in education? If not, how do you         think they need to be modified?</b> </p>      <p>Group 2 agreed that the principles were accurate and required no revisions         or additions. Some members wanted a mention of the link between research         and practice in principle No. 1 (Pose Significant Questions That Can Be         Investigated Empirically). If researchers are asking good questions, they         need to know what practitioners are doing. </p>      <p>Group members discussed how schools and RELs are struggling with these         principles because the research questions drill down to such a detailed         level instead of placed in context. The smaller the question, the less         valuable it is because it doesn't tie back to the broader perspective.       </p>      <p>REL staff in Group 2 said that some of the work that the RELs received         and schools are conducting was set up under different principles prior         to the No Child Left Behind Act and the scientifically based research         discussion. Researchers in the group noted that these principles are not         new, but people may not be providing well-posed questions. </p>      <p>Members discussed how the new guidelines might affect the current work         of states that wrote proposals prior to the No Child Left Behind Act legislation.         Rather than start over, schools and REL staff will probably just try to         meet the guidelines as best they can in their current work. </p>      <p>Then Group 2 discussed how the Department of Education's definition of         scientifically based research is much more narrow than that presented         in the National Research Council's (NRC's) report <I>Scientific Research         in Education</I>. Group members also reviewed the recent political history         of the RELs to determine how the current administration would like labs         to adhere to research principles. Before 1985, the labs bridged the gap         between research and practice. With the next contract, the labs let research         capacity go and adopted a development and dissemination role. The current         administration would like RELs to be solely training, professional development,         and technical assistance (TA) providers because they think RELs cannot         attract top researchers like universities. The labs are resisting this         TA and training role. The current administration began backing off its         strict scientifically based research methodology after the NRC report         was published. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></p>      <p><b>Question 2: Given your group's definition, how do you think SEDL should         attend to scientific research, and the quality (or rigor) of it, in our         work? What would we need to do differently in order to act on scientific         research in the manner you recommend? </b></p>      <p>Group 2 members noted that the current political climate has huge implications         for SEDL, but that does not mean we have to frame our definition of scientifically         based research around the current administration's definition. </p>      <p>Non-REL staff in the group wanted to discuss the purpose of the labs         and learn more about the REL's research to see if REL staff already apply         some of the principles. But the group also emphasized these principles         should be applied to the whole institution, not just the REL and research         aspects of SEDL. For instance: </p>      <ul>        <li> Evaluation should follow the same six principles but with a different           purpose. Evaluation determines the impact of SEDL's dissemination of           materials, and it must be built into the research process at the very           beginning to ensure its rigor. </li>        <li> The quality assurance (QA) process should be used beforehand to determine           significance and rigor. All SEDL products and services could go through           QA&#151;not just REL's. This process could be used to defend research           questions as well. If the questions can't be defended, they shouldn't           be researched. Products and services that don't adhere to six principles           and/or go through QA could have a "buyer beware" label that reads "a           lot of practitioners think this works, but there's not a lot of evidence."         </li>        <li> SEDL and Dana Center should build in more time for peer review during           self-publishing process and encourage staff to publish in peer-reviewed           journals. </li>      </ul>      <p>Group 2 also considered SEDL's joining a community of scientists. How         do we become a part of this community? Who are our peers (universities?)?         What partnerships should we try to develop? </p>      <p>Lastly, the group suggesting bolstering the research experience among         SEDL staff and clients. Group members pointed out that there are not a         lot of true researchers on the SEDL staff, but people in the field often         expect staff to evaluate, present, and do research. Staff do not have         to be researchers, but they need to be connected to research. More staff         are developers and disseminators than researchers, but they need to be         sure research guides their work. By understanding the six principles,         all SEDL staff can discern which research is actually scientifically based         and pass this skill on to practitioners in the field. SEDL staff also         could create more rigorous development processes and better proposals         by continuously questioning what we do and making sure it ties to the         six principles, by looking for significant questions, and by sharing our         knowledge company-wide through informal staff sessions. </p>      <p>On a program level, REL Task 1.1 staff could review their current work         and show how it's based on research. REL Task 1.3 staff, whose main audience         is policy makers, could generalize across studies more (principle No.         5&#151;Replicate and Generalize Across Studies). They could do meta analysis         and synthesize the minutiae so that both applied and theoretical folks         have something with which to work. </p>      <p>Group 2 also emphasized that SEDL staff need to be spanners of both research         and practice. SEDL staff are out in the field, so they can work to link         practitioners to researchers better. SEDL staff need to take information         from the field to the researchers (reverse dissemination) just as much         as staff take information from researchers to the field. Staff can be         the voice of practitioners by gathering their questions and passing them         along to researchers so that researchers can do more relevant research.         SEDL needs to develop partnerships to improve this flow of information.         <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a> </p>      <p><b>Question 3: To be a successful RD&D institution, where success is         defined in terms of our ability to build knowledge and bring it to bear         on practice, are there other types of knowledge that we need to pay attention         to beyond that which comes from scientific research? If so what are they,         how well do you think we attend to them, and what would we need to do         in order to better act on them? </b></p>      <ul>        <li>           <p><b>Practical knowledge synthesis: </b>SEDL could codify and synthesize             the practical knowledge that teachers use but does not appear in any             books. To be codified, it would have to go through the six principles.             If staff provide advice that is not based on research, they must tell             the client with a disclaimer. But that may make people reluctant to             use it. </p>        </li>        <li>           <p><b>Knowledge on decision-making process:</b> SEDL could codify, synthesize,             and share common sense tips on decision-making processes with practitioners.           </p>        </li>        <li>           <p><b>Context knowledge:</b> Includes the factors that impact schools             and communities and the priorities of schools. </p>        </li>        <li>           <p><b> Belief system research:</b> SEDL doesn't have a lot of research             pulled together on changing beliefs, but we're really good at this             (What's the relationship between changing beliefs and practice? How             do we help people under their needs, motivate them, and get their             buy-in? How do we build their trust?).

This wisdom can be a basis for further research that             follows the six principles. </p>        </li>        <li>           <p><b> Inspirational stories:</b> These are important, but they're not             research even though they are sometimes presented as research. Staff             need to be careful with these because often there are too many variables             to pinpoint what actually makes the impact. </p>        </li>        <li>           <p><b> Existence proofs</b> (For example, it used to be widely that             poor kids just would not do well at school.

If not, how do you think they need to         be modified? </b></p>      <p>We addressed this question by discussing each of the six principles.       </p>      <p><I>1. Pose significant questions that can be investigated empirically</I><br>        The two components of this principle are both important. First, the identification         of significant questions is critical to a successful study, although,         how we determine what is significant is not easy. Second, empirical investigation         is an appropriate form of inquiry for scientific research. Other points         raised about this principle: </p>      <ul>        <li> We can raise significant questions without necessarily knowing how           we might investigate them empirically. </li>        <li> Significant questions do not need to be unique and the same question           can be asked again and again, creating iterative results, nuances of           new information, and verification and expansion of results. </li>        <li> Significant questions are important because they help us fill gaps           in knowledge and test hypotheses. </li>      </ul>      <p>A related issue that we discussed was the difference between qualitative         and quantitative research and the relevance of this principle to each.         The language used by the authors seems to more support a quantitative         perspective, mirroring the current debate regarding the different roles         of quantitative and qualitative methods in education. The debate regarding         the two methods may also reflect the problem in education of misuse of         qualitative research. </p>      <p><I>2. Link research to relevant theory</I><BR>        What is theory? </p>      <ul>        <li> Theory is the framework that supports research activities&#151;many           times education research lacks a theoretical ground. </li>        <li>We use theory to build new knowledge. </li>        <li> Theory allows us to fill gaps and also helps us predict. </li>        <li>Theory does not need to be previously researched. A related issue           that we discussed is that we have a lot of theories about learning,           but not about how schools operate as organizations. </li>      </ul>      <p><I>3. Use methods that permit direct investigation of the question</I><BR>        We identified this principle as a weak area in education research. This         is because we are investigating processes and phenomenon that are difficult         to fully and directly measure. We also discussed the role of the design         process in helping to identify an appropriate method. Many factors are         important in the design process: resources, timeline, desired results.         There is a tendency in education research to pursue mixed methods. Both         qualitative and quantitative data are collected; however, many times we         gloss over the distinctions between the two methods and the fact that         they have different historical foundations. </p>      <p><I>4. Provide a coherent and explicit chain of reasoning</I><BR>        The limits of this principle are that, applied to the interpretation of         education issues, it can oversimplify a complex world. This principle         assumes that everything will fit together in a logical way. In real life         there will be outliers and exceptions that need to be accounted for and         incorporated. Also, "breakthroughs" in research are often the result of         getting off of the logical path of thinking to get a fresh perspective.       </p>      <p><I>5. Replicate and generalize across studies</I><BR>        This principle is vague and raises concerns of feasibility. How many times         should a study be repeated? And where will the support come from to do         a study over again and again? For SEDL, this is an important issue since         we focus on technical assistance to practitioners and we want to have         researched-based recommendations. But we may be limited in our capacity         to verify research findings through replication. We also clarified that         replication of research should be performed by a different researcher.       </p>      <p><I>6. Disclose research to encourage professional scrutiny and critique</I><BR>        This principle is important, however, it is very rare for the research         community to request a researcher's data to critique his/her findings.         We discussed the importance of the ethics of scientific research and the         instances in which personal/political agendas lead to doctoring of results.         We also discussed peer-reviewed journals as a possible ground for sharing         and discussing results. We also shared some overarching comments: </p>      <ul>        <li> The role of ethics in scientific research are implicit in the descriptions           of principles Nos. 5 and 6, however, it could be made more explicit.         </li>        <li> The connection between research and practice could be reconciled           better. In the scientific research model presented, practice is not           given credence. Questions remain such as what is the interaction between           best practice and scientific research? How does research inform and           serve practice? How does practice inform and serve scientific research? <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a>        </li>      </ul>	  <p><a href="session2-072202-2.html">Groups 4-6</a></p>      <p><a href="http://www.sedl.org/staff/information/sciencebased/">Resource         Archive: Scientific Research in SEDL's Work</a></p>      <!--#include virtual="/staff/includes/footer.txt"-->
