In synthesizing         those notes, our goal was to try to capture the main issues that had been         raised. You should think of these as guidance to better focus the discussion         of these same questions that will take place on August 1. </p>      <p>We encourage you to read all of the small group reports as well as the         synthesis as you get ready for participation in those discussions. The         synthesis, organized around the three main question sets used in <br>        the July 22 discussions, follows. </p>      <p><b>Question 1: Are the six principles given in the NRC report adequate         for defining scientific research in education? If not, how do you think         they need to be modified? </b></p>      <p>In general, each group supported the six principles as important standards         for scientific research in education. There was less agreement that the         principles defined scientific research in education, more that they provided         guidelines for judging research efforts as scientific. </p>      <p>The major issues raised across the groups were around more clearly defining         a number of the principles, as many discussants felt that if SEDL were         to adopt these principles, then some would need to be better described         before we could apply them in our work. </p>      <p>Below are the major issues raised around each of the six NRC principles,         followed by a set of miscellaneous concerns: </p>      <ol>        <li> Pose significant questions that can be investigated empirically           <ul>            <li> What does “significant” mean? Is it the same as “important?”             </li>            <li> For SEDL, would the application of this principle mean that there               must be a strong connection to education practice? </li>          </ul>        </li>        <li> Link research to relevant theory           <ul>            <li> What does &quot;relevant&quot; mean? Again, for SEDL to apply               this principle, would it mean there must be a strong connection               to a theory of practice? </li>          </ul>        </li>        <li> Use methods that permit direct investigation of the question </li>        <ul>          <li> What does “direct investigation” mean? </li>          <li> How does the notion of converging evidence relate to this principle             (and to the fifth principle as well)? </li>          <li> How do the constraints of resources (funding, time, people) impact             the selection of methods? </li>          <li> How does the quantitative-qualitative distinction relate to this             methods principle (and to the entire set of principles in general)?           </li>        </ul>        <li> Provide a coherent and explicit chain of reasoning           <ul>            <li> To what does this apply (e.g., the connections between question,               evidence, and conclusion; the connections between findings, implications,               and applications)? </li>          </ul>        </li>        <li> Replicate and generalize across studies           <ul>            <li> What is the role of contextual factors in dealing with the issue               of replication? </li>          </ul>        </li>        <li> Disclose research to encourage professional scrutiny and critique.           <ul>            <li> How do ethics fit inside this principle (and the others)? </li>            <li> Does this principle adequately capture the notion of the social               construction of knowledge?</li>          </ul>        </li>      </ol>      <p>Miscellaneous issues: </p>      <ol>        <ul>          <li> Should SEDL be concerned about the order of the principles? </li>          <li> What is the interrelationship between knowledge based in research             and that based in best practice? </li>        </ul>      </ol>      <p><b>Question 2: Given your group’s definition, how do you think SEDL should         attend to scientific research, and the quality (or rigor) of it, in our         work? What would we need to do differently to act on scientific research         in the manner you recommend? </b></p>      <p>Suggested changes to current SEDL practices that were made by multiple         groups were: </p>      <ul>        <li> SEDL should conduct institution-wide discussions to strengthen our           collective understanding of the theoretical bases for our work. </li>        <li> SEDL should develop a program of RD&D based on these theoretical           bases and become proactive in securing funding to support and sustain           our programs of work. </li>        <li> SEDL should review its current work to determine the extent to which           it is aligned with the principles of scientific research, including           our approach to professional development, our approach to working with           schools, and our current research and evaluation projects. SEDL should           take steps to bring its work into alignment with these principles as           appropriate. </li>        <li> The QA process should begin at the conception of projects and be           part of the entire process of completing the work (as an internal peer           review process). </li>        <li> SEDL should promote and support with time and resources the publication           of its research in refereed journals (as an external peer review process).         </li>        <li> SEDL’s work spans both research and practice, and thus, we need competencies           in both. SEDL staff should understand and apply the principles of scientific           research to become better producers and consumers of research. </li>        <li> To increase staff understanding, an ongoing dialogue at SEDL among           those who work primarily with practitioners and those who work primarily           on research should be conducted. Ongoing professional development should           be provided in research methods and research practice. Differing amounts           and depths of professional development should be provided for staff           depending on their individual roles at SEDL. </li>        <li> SEDL should help PK-12 practitioners understand the principles of           scientific research to become better consumers of research. </li>        <li> SEDL should help practitioners identify significant questions and           carry out “action research” following the principles of scientific research.         </li>        <li> Practitioners should help define appropriate research questions and           work with the SEDL researchers. </li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 3: To be a successful RD&D institution, where success is         defined in terms of our ability to build knowledge and bring it to bear         on practice, are there other types of knowledge that we need to pay attention         to beyond that which comes from scientific research? If so, what are they,         how well do you think we attend to them, and what would we need to do         in order to better act on them? </b></p>      <p>Yes, there are other types of knowledge SEDL needs to pay attention to         as a producer and consumer/facilitator of scientific research. These other         types of knowledge include: </p>      <ul>        <li> Professional knowledge (found in best practice) </li>        <li> Community-based knowledge (beliefs and values) </li>        <li> Political knowledge </li>        <li> Procedural knowledge </li>        <li> Practical knowledge </li>        <li> Contextual knowledge </li>        <li> Conventional wisdom </li>      </ul>      <p>SEDL recognizes the existence of these other types of knowledge but does         not consistently attend to them. In most cases, these other forms of knowledge         are held by individuals or sub-groups of staff. There is no internal mechanism,         procedure, or process to capture these forms of knowledge so that they         can be made available throughout SEDL’s RD&D operations. </p>      <p>SEDL could better act on other kinds of knowledge by: </p>      <ul>        <li> Capturing and codifying this “collective wisdom” in a way that reconciles           best practice and scientific research, and makes that information broadly           available within SEDL and across other relevant constituencies. </li>        <li> Providing more staff training that addresses coherence between scientific           knowledge (associated with the six principles) and other types of knowledge.         </li>      </ul>      <p><a href="http://www.sedl.org/staff/information/sciencebased/">Resource         Archive: Scientific Research in SEDL's Work</a></p>      <!--#include virtual="/staff/includes/footer.txt"-->
