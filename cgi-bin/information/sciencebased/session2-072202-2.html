If not, how do you think         they need to be modified? The group agreed with the principles, with several         qualifiers:</b> </p>      <p> The principles, as stated, are quite broad and leave a great deal open         to interpretation. It might be too easy to fit almost any study under         them. </p>      <p> <i>1. Pose Significant Questions That Can Be Investigated Empirically<br>        </i> This principle notes that we should pose questions that can be investigated         empirically. It should be noted that a definition of the word empirical         (American College Dictionary) is 1. derived from or guided by experience         or experiment. We need to remember that not all empirical studies are         quantitative nor are they experiments. </p>      <p> <i>2. Link Research to Relevant Theory</i><br>        The definition of "relevant" is important as values come into play here&#151;false         sense of objectivity. </p>      <p><i>3. Use Methods That Permit Direct Investigation of the Question</i><br>        We should strive for triangulation of methods, not rely on one method         for investigation of a question. </p>      <p><i>4. Provide a Coherent and Explicit Chain of Reasoning</i><br>        Emphasizes idea that we have "coherent and explicit" reasoning, not just         "logic" </p>      <p><i>5. Replicate and Generalize Across Studies</i><br>        For replication and generalizability, we must consider the contextual         factors that come into play. </p>      <p><i>6. Disclose Research to Encourage Professional Scrutiny and Critique</i><br>        Peer review should not be left until the end. Rather, it should be engaged         from the selection of the question forward. We should strive for a diversity         of "peers," not just those that agree with our frame of reference or content         expertise. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></p>      <p><b>Question 2: Given your group's definition, how do you think SEDL should         attend to scientific research, and the quality (or rigor) of it, in our         work? What would we need to do differently in order to act on scientific         research in the manner you recommend? </b></p>      <ul>        <li> SEDL should help practitioners understand "scientific research,"           i.e., principles. 2. SEDL should be apprised of scientific research           related to the field of practice based on the needs of audiences (i.e.,           practitioners or policy makers). </li>        <li> SEDL should help practitioners look at significant questions about           practice and move toward researching existing practice using the principles.         </li>        <li> SEDL should do scientific research on existing practice using the           principles. </li>        <li> SEDL should examine/change its review process, including internal           and external advisory boards and make sure this is a process at all           levels of the institution (whole institution, individual projects, etc.).         </li>        <li> SEDL needs to examine current research and identify future research           in terms of whether we are following the six principles. In cases where           we are not, we need to find ways to make efforts to more closely match           the principles or explain our reasoning and method regarding why we           are not applying some of all of the principles. </li>        <li> SEDL should identify/develop institutional support/funds/expertise           for scientific research. Is this a priority for SEDL? 8. SEDL should           develop short- and long-term goals related to dealing with current regional           education issues/needs that integrate scientific research as a priority           so that we can be an important RD&D entity in the region. </li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 3: To be a successful RD&D institution, where success is         defined in terms of our ability to build knowledge and bring it to bear         on practice, are there other types of knowledge that we need to pay attention         to beyond that which comes from scientific research? If so what are they,         how well do you think we attend to them, and what would we need to do         in order to better act on them? </b></p>      <ul>        <li> We need to collect/develop contextual information about the region,           including such information as policies, student populations, practitioner-identified           needs, etc. </li>        <li> SEDL needs to aggregate and describe the practical wisdom in our           region&#151;what do practitioners believe about what works and upon           what evidence is that based? </li>        <li> We need a better understanding of the political context by placing           importance on policy/legislative issues and those in decision-making           positions in order to move toward better development of both policy.           <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a> </li>      </ul>      <a name="group5">       <h4>Group 5</h4>      </a>       <p><b>Group members present:</b> Cathy Jordan, Tara Leo, Danny Martinez         (facilitator), Erin McCann (recorder/reporter), Victor Rodriguez, Joann         Starks, Maria Torres, Karen Wohlblatt (synthesizer), Lacy Wood       <p><b>Question 1: Are the six principles given in the NRC report adequate         for defining scientific research in education? If not, how do you think         they need to be modified? </b>       <p>We agreed with the principles from the book, as long as they can be applied.         Our primary reservations were with principles Nos. 5 (Replicate and Generalize         Across Studies) and 6 (Disclose Research to Encourage Professional Scrutiny         and Critique), particularly the issues of generalizability and replicability,         as qualitative work does not as easily embody these principles.       <p><b>Question 2: Given your group's definition, how do you think SEDL should         attend to scientific research, and the quality (or rigor) of it, in our         work?

The research design should be something           that many people in the organization participate in developing. </li>        <li> We should have more staff training on qualitative research and scientific           research methods with respect to our task work. The training should           be first general, and then made specific to the work individuals are           doing. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></li>      </ul>           <a name="group6">       <h4>Group 6</h4>      </a>       <p><b>Group members present: </b>Laurie Born, Jackie Burniske, Nikki Hanegan,         Joyce Pollard, Eric Waters, Sebastian Wren (reporting)       <p><b>Question 1: Are the six principles given in the NRC report adequate         for defining scientific research in education?

The primary condition was that the principles were not         treated consistently in language, description, and examples. Some of these         seem to be steps in "THE scientific method" not "principles" of scientific         research. Others seem to focus on the process of scientifically expanding         the boundaries of knowledge. These principles should be focused more on         the latter than the former.       <p>Six principles of "Scientific Research" in education as described in         the NRC report:       <ol>        <li> Pose significant questions that can be investigated empirically </li>        <li> Link research to relevant theory </li>        <li>Use methods that permit direct investigation of the question </li>        <li>Provide a coherent and explicit chain of reasoning </li>        <li>Replicate and generalize across studies </li>        <li>Disclose research to encourage professional scrutiny and critique.         </li>      </ol>      <p>Hallmarks of THE Scientific Method of Inquiry:       <ol>        <li> A clearly defined, falsifiable hypothesis based upon prior empirical           observation, </li>        <li> Testable predictions that stem from the hypothesis. What would be           observed if the hypothesis was true? What would be observed if the hypothesis           was false? </li>        <li> Well-defined variables (independent and dependent) related to the           (clearly defined) operational definition of the construct under consideration           as well as the stated hypothesis. </li>        <li> Tightly controlled experimental design employing control groups,           random assignment to treatment variables, and other approaches to account           for (if not control) extraneous variables. </li>        <li> Objective analysis of data. </li>        <li> Objective conclusions about hypothesis based on data observed. And           replication is important to the scientific process overall. </li>      </ol>      <blockquote>         <p><I>The scientific method has never been thoroughly studied scientifically.           &#151;Terry Halwes</I> </p>      </blockquote>      <p>Within the principles, there is terminology that is too loosely defined.         For example, what is &quot;direct investigation&quot;? Do you have to         follow &quot;THE scientific method of inquiry&quot; to engage in &quot;direct         investigation&quot;? What is a &quot;significant question&quot;? Is it         the same as an &quot;important question&quot;? Is it possible to do scientific         research in an area that some might not consider &quot;important&quot;?         Who decides?      <p>Also, as stated, these principles could be too strict. With a very loose         interpretation, these principles are good guidelines&#151;starting points&#151;but         some in the group voiced concerns that they might be used as a strict         set of guidelines that must be followed. What does it mean to "use methods         that permit direct investigation of the question"? If that is not defined,         how can we use it as a guideline?       <p>Also, the principles are not consistently defined within the NRC report.         In places they are more liberal in their definition, allowing for any         research that is rigorous (including quantitative, qualitative, and other         approaches). In other places, they are much more rigid, describing simple         experiments that more strictly adhere to the hallmarks of "THE scientific         method of inquiry." What is SEDL's view?       <p>The group discussed a host of "non-causal studies" &#151;studies that         contribute to the body of research evidence within a field but that do         not adhere to "THE scientific method of inquiry": Ethnographic studies,         case studies, naturalistic inquiry, surveys, correlational studies, literature         reviews, meta-analyses, and others. Confidence stems from conclusions         that are drawn from a variety of studies that approach the research question         in a variety of ways. Researchers place confidence in SUBSTANTIAL CONVERGENT         EVIDENCE.       <p>We felt that the message that should be taken from the NRC report is         that there is already a large body of education research that could be         described as "emergent" research, or "non-causal" research, but that there         is a dearth of complementing "scientifically rigorous" research, and that         without the scientifically rigorous research, there is inadequate convergent         evidence to provide confidence. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></p>      <p><b>Question 2: Given your group's definition, how do you think SEDL should         attend to scientific research and the quality (or rigor) of it, in our         work? What would we need to do differently in order to act on scientific         research in the manner you recommend? </b>      <blockquote>        <p><I>The great tragedy of Science; the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis           by an ugly fact.<br>          &#151;Thomas Henry Huxley</I> </p>      </blockquote>      <p>There is an important question to be addressed: Are we to endeavoring         to become better CONSUMERS of scientific research information, or are         we to become better PRODUCERS of scientific research information? It was         the consensus of this group that we should be focusing on both. The institution         as a whole needs to have clear standards of quality for literature review         and dissemination of research evidence, and we should apply those same         standards of quality to the research that we produce.       <p>We also think that SEDL needs to become more proactive in conducting         research&#151;rather than responding to RFPs and engaging in contract-specific         work, we need to establish our area of research expertise and seek money         to keep that research moving forward.       <p>For example, through our work in the field, we have developed a lot of         institutional wisdom about effective approaches to professional development,         but we have never tested the "SEDL approach" to professional development         empirically. We have a SEDL-wide consensus on what good professional development         looks like, but we have not formalized our theories very clearly, and         we certainly have not tested our theories about professional development         very objectively. We also know that other people in the field have not         conducted what we would call "high-quality" research in that area, either         (to illustrate, there is almost no research in approaches to professional         development that uses student performance data as a dependant variable).         Certainly SEDL is in a position to conduct high-quality, empirical, objective         research in the area of professional development, and publish the results         of that research in peer-reviewed journals (either instead of, or in addition         to, our own in-house publications, which have traditionally been the avenue         of dissemination that SEDL has used). <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></p>		 <p><a href="http://www.sedl.org/staff/information/sciencebased/">Resource         Archive: Scientific Research in SEDL's Work</a></p>        <!--#include virtual="/staff/includes/footer.txt"-->
