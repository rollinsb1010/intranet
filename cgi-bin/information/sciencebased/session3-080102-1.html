There was discussion on the &#147;messiness&#148;         of research, including the difficulty of adhering to the six principles         when you are in the field and conducting research with ordinary people.         The principles in the book are based on a &#147;perfect world,&#148; commented         one group member. The National Reading Panel (NRP) study is an example         of research in the real world and this panel was subject to political         pressures and time pressures.</p>      <p><b>Question 2: Did this particular case lead you to change your thoughts         about any of the principles defining scientific research you felt were         important from your discussion in Session II? If so, how?</b></p>      <p>Our group decided that more value needed to be placed on the design principles         in the book <i>Scientific Research in Education</i>. These include the         need to create structures to guide agendas and monitor work; insulate         agency from political interference; and develop a balanced portfolio of         short-, medium-, and long-term issues of importance to policy and practice.</p>      <p><b>Question 3: Would you change your responses to any of the other questions         you addressed in the previous session concerning SEDL&#146;s attention         to scientific research and other sources of knowledge based on your discussions         in this session? If so what changes would you make?</b></p>      <p>Group 1 still sees the need to come to a working definition of scientifically         based research. The group discussed the need to operationalize the six         scientific principles and how the definition might vary in different arenas&#151;at         SEDL, for higher education, for practitioners. </p>      <p><b>Question 4: Does the Session II synthesis accurately reflect your         group&#146;s discussion? </b></p>      <p>Under Question 2, the second bullet, we thought there had been more discussion         on being proactive about becoming a more theoretically based RD&amp;D         institution, not just being more proactive in securing funding.</p>      <p><b>Question 5: Do you want to continue the dialogue on scientifically         based research via a listserv or a bulletin board?</b></p>      <p>Most of Group 1 members were not enthusiastic about a bulletin board         or a listserv. Most felt that for such electronic conversations to work         effectively, participants would need to be highly motivated with the time         to engage in such discussion.</p>      <p><b>Additional notes from the discussion:</b></p>      <p>Our discussion of the NRP study focused on the political agenda that         seemed to be in place. One group member felt &#147;in this case, the political         agenda covers itself in a scientific mantle.&#148; </p>      <p>There was discussion on Russell Whitehurst&#146;s view of what constitutes         scientifically based research and whether that is the view that SEDL as         an institution should take. There was also quite a bit of discussion on         SEDL and other similar institutions being &#147;beholden&#148; to the         federal government for our funding and how this affects the research that         we carry out. The group concluded that by trying to be more &#147;politically         correct&#148; to satisfy the feds&#146; current definition of research,         we would actually be moving away from the six scientific principles that         everyone had generally agreed were sound. There was further discussion         that the scientific principles were a powerful lens through which to view         research. </p>      <p>Because so much of the SEDL staff spends time in the field with practitioners,         the group also discussed our role ofproviding &#147;scientifically based         research&#148; to practitioners. Group members mentioned that many school         and district staff are totally focused on NCLB and they want help with         regard to what is scientifically based research. If we used the narrow         definition of scientifically based research, we would have little to offer,         when in reality there is much research if we use a broader definition.         There was discussion about being more expansive with research findings,         e.g., identifying them as good descriptive studies and being more specific         about the role the findings play in the research scheme of things. </p>      <p>The group then turned its attention to our role as creators of research         and information instead of as disseminators. There was some discussion         of work produced in the field not being valued in the institution; the         point was made that even though SEDL staff may be doing training, there         was a lot of background research-related work that was necessary to get         to that point. Also, our work with practitioners enables us to add to         the knowledge base.</p>      <p>One group member observed that because our research was not experimental,         it seemed we were being pushed out of the research arena into the technical         assistance arena. This led us back to the discussion we had during Session         II on July 22 about being proactive in becoming an independent research         organization that can be competitive for the knowledge-building funding.         We see our strength as being contextual, we are working in schools most         of the time, but how do we build our research presence when 75 percent         of our staff members are more practitioners than researchers?</p>      <p>There was also some discussion on how fluid the organization is in terms         of staffing and what that means to a research organization that is theory         driven. The group also noted our need to connect to the current research         community and participate in it.<a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></p>      <a name="group2">       <h4>Group 2</h4>      </a>       <p><b>Group members present: </b>Sean Claes, Johanna Franke (recorder),         Ashley Galaway, Margarita Greer (facilitator), Cori Groth, Wes Hoover,         Kim Hughes, Patricia Keith, Vangie Orozco, Joe Parker (reporter), Sue         Street (synthesizer)</p>      <p><b>Question 1: What did you learn from this session&#146;s readings that         changed your understanding of scientific research in education?</b></p>      <p>Legitimizing only scientifically based research has the potential to         eliminate some of the more complex phenomena.</p>      <ul>        <li> You&#146;re not asking some of the most important questions because           they&#146;re not easily measured.</li>        <li> Is &#147;scientifically based research&#148; a code term for strictly           experimental research? No, the six principles say the method needs to           match the question, but the method does not have to be experimental.           Some areas of study lend themselves to more experimental/quasi-experimental           methodologies; those areas that do not are not being explored.</li>      </ul>      <p>Group 2 members say they still aren&#146;t really clear on what scientific         research in education means after reading the assigned articles for today&#146;s         session. They also believe SEDL should revisit the six principles and         determine exactly what they mean to the institution as a whole; otherwise,         different people will interpret them in different ways. </p>      <p><b>Question 2: Did this particular case lead you to change your thoughts         about any of the principles defining scientific research you felt were         important from your discussion in Session II? If so, how?</b></p>      <ul>        <li> SEDL may need to explore how methods such as the descriptive method           fit into a scientifically based research definition. Descriptive data           and empirical data should inform one another.</li>        <li> The six principles should direct researchers to explicitly describe           assumptions/underpinnings of theory in their research.</li>        <li> More clarification of what the principles mean would help SEDL staff           talk about scientifically based research in the field.</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 3: Would you change your responses to any of the other questions         you addressed in the previous session concerning SEDL&#146;s attention         to scientific research and other sources of knowledge based on your discussions         in this session? If so, what changes would you make?</b></p>      <p>We&#146;d add the following to the answer to Question 2, &#147;What does         SEDL need to do in order to ensure high-quality work based on the definition         of scientifically based research?&#148; </p>      <ul>        <li> Develop an understanding and possible uses of what SEDL has already           done in related work. Build on previous project learnings and gather           the information using a specific type of methodology. Do this with a           database complete with knowledge management that can ensure data are           useful to people viewing the database in the future. </li>        <li> Examine SEDL&#146;s quality assurance process to see how it aligns           with the six principles and emphasize peer review.</li>      </ul>      <p>We&#146;d also add the following to the answer to Question 3, &#147;Are         there other types of knowledge beyond scientific research that bears on         practice? If so, what are they, do we attend to them, and how can we better         act on them?&#148; </p>      <ul>        <li>Some education questions may have answers based on research done outside           the educational field, e.g., anthropology, sociology, psychology, political           science, and economics.</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 4: Does the Session II synthesis accurately reflect your         group&#146;s discussion?</b></p>      <p>We should be more explicit about &#147;our work&#148; in the first bullet         of Question 2 (&#147;SEDL should conduct institution-wide discussions         to strengthen our collective understanding of the theoretical bases for         our work.&#148;) by listing the six focus areas that make up SEDL&#146;s         work:</p>      <ul>        <li> Improving school performance</li>        <li> Strengthening teaching and learning in content areas</li>        <li> Integrating technology into teaching and learning</li>        <li> Involving family and community in student learning</li>        <li> Connecting disability research to practice</li>        <li> Supporting policy development through research</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 5: Do you want to continue the dialogue on scientifically         based research via a listserv or a bulletin board?</b></p>      <ul>        <li> If it is a bulletin board, it needs to be facilitated and synthesized           on a regular basis and shared with everyone. An e-mail summarizing the           bulletin board activity should be sent out once a week. </li>        <li> It should expand, not eliminate, the face-to-face cross-lab meetings.           It needs to include all of SEDL, including the Dana Center.</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Additional notes from the discussion:</b></p>      <ul>        <li> The reporting in the articles and NRP report did not appear to indicate           the use of the latest research methods.</li>        <li> The NRP limited their methodology because of their narrow charge.</li>        <li> The NRP report provides research components, but it also lists limitation           after limitation for each component.

There was little explicit chain of reasoning               or a coherent explanation of the theory it was based upon. They               did not do such a good job of disclosing the research for review               or critique before it was published.</li>            <li> Professional scrutiny is good&#151;if this is one of the &#147;best               case&#148; examples of scientific research in education, what does               that say for the other fields of education?</li>          </ul>        </li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 2: Did this particular case lead you to change your thoughts         about any of the principles defining scientific research you felt were         important from your discussion in Session II? If so, how?</b></p>      <p>After a brief discussion about the methodological overview in the NRP         report (p. 5), we proceeded to examine the NRP report as it related to         the six principles of scientific research:</p>      <ul>        <li> Is it fair to apply these six principles to a synthesis of research?           <ul>            <li> Yes, though there was some dissention about whether that was               an appropriate objective for a synthesis of literature. We decided               this is an example of a poor job of doing scientific research, and               that the principles themselves were not defective. The principles               were not completely followed by the NRP report committee members.</li>          </ul>        </li>        <li> Would we modify the six principles of doing scientific research in           any way?           <ul>            <li> Yes. We thought about the &#147;ethics&#148; principle that we               discussed in Session II and decided that it may be worthwhile to               have a seventh principle that explicitly states the importance of               stating your theoretical perspectives, the context (e.g., political               influences), limitations, mediating factors, etc.</li>          </ul>        </li>        <li> Questions to ask when conducting scientific research in education:           <ul>            <li> Are you systematically sorting out studies that don&#146;t agree               with your point?</li>            <li> Are you able to state your assumptions outright and justify why               you took a certain approach?</li>            <li> Did you include any information about competing hypotheses and               how they affect your work?</li>          </ul>        </li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 3: Would you change your responses to any of the other questions         you addressed in the previous session concerning SEDL&#146;s attention         to scientific research and other sources of knowledge based on your discussions         in this session?
