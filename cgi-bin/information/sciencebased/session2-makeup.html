If not, how do you think         they need to be modified?</B> </p>      <ul>        <li> The six principles are correlated to all research standards, no matter           the design or type. </li>        <li>“Education” has to be related to student achievement to be of value           to the field. </li>        <li> The words and phrasing in these principles are as value laden as           much of what is seen commonly in other educational writing. </li>        <li> The text speaks of significant questions, yet have the simple questions           been answered? </li>        <li> It is really more of an issue of <I>how do</I> researchers come to           the significant questions.           <ul>            <li> Who is posing it? </li>            <li> What are the ones that need to be answered? </li>            <li> Sometimes the question that is asked is keeping researchers from               getting to what is really wanted. </li>            <li> Questions must be related to relevant theory. </li>          </ul>        </li>        <li> In general, SEDL is good at articulating the method; we are not as           good at articulating the theory. </li>      </ul>      <p><B>Question 2: Given your group's definition, how do you think SEDL should         attend to scientific research, and the quality (or rigor) of it, in our         work? What would we need to do differently in order to act on scientific         research in the manner you recommend?</B> </p>      <ul>        <li> As an organization, SEDL should have a general theoretical base.         </li>      </ul>      <p align=center><img src="graph.jpg" width="300" height="109" align="middle" alt="graph"></p>      <ul>        <ul>          <li> Does SEDL have a core theory that drives all of the work? </li>          <li> Do we want to move away from applied research? </li>        </ul>        <li> All SEDL staff need a greater understanding of research&#151;nuts           and bolts and conceptualization. </li>        <li> The institution needs to identify what is the focus of research for           the whole institution.           <ul>            <li> Doing a general exploration type of research before delving into               the larger research projects would be ideal.</li>            <li> SEDL should also tie more strongly to a theoretical base before               moving research forward. </li>            <li> There needs to be a better marriage of fieldwork and research.             </li>            <li> There needs to be an effort to break down the silos in projects               and across projects to share not only the work focus but also the               research learnings. </li>            <li> There needs to be a scaffolded approach to the research. </li>            <li> How much of our research agenda is impacted by politics? </li>          </ul>        </li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 3: To be a successful RD&D institution, where success is         defined in terms of our ability to build knowledge and bring it to bear         on practice, are there other types of knowledge that we need to pay attention         to beyond that which comes from scientific research? If so what are they,         how well do you think we attend to them, and what would we need to do         in order to better act on them?</b> </p>      <ul>        <li> There are many scientific research bases that SEDL is not making           use of:           <ul>            <li> Team dynamics </li>            <li> Relationship building </li>            <li> Trust building </li>            <li> Motivation </li>            <li> Cultural knowledge </li>            <li> Organizational/systems </li>            <li> Conceptual knowledge </li>          </ul>        </li>      </ul>      <p><a href="http://www.sedl.org/staff/information/sciencebased/">Resource         Archive: Scientific Research in SEDL's Work</a></p>      <!--#include virtual="/staff/includes/footer.txt"-->
