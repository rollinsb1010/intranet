Following the original format, this synthesis is         organized around the three Session II questions. </p>      <p><b>Question 1: Are the six principles given in the National Research         Council (NRC) report adequate for defining scientific research in education?         If not, how do you think they need to be modified? </b></p>      <p>In general, each group supported the six principles as important standards         for judging research efforts as scientific. The major issues raised across         the groups were around more clearly defining a number of the principles,         as many discussants felt that if SEDL were to adopt these principles,         then some would need to be better described before we could apply them         in our work. Below are the major issues raised around each of the six         NRC principles: </p>      <p><i>1. Pose significant questions that can be investigated empirically         </i></p>      <ul>        <li> What does “significant” mean? Is it the same as “important”? Does           it mean “complex” as opposed to “simple”? </li>        <li> For SEDL would the application of this principle mean that there           must be a strong connection to education practice? </li>      </ul>      <p><i>2. Link research to relevant theory </i></p>      <ul>        <li> What does “relevant” mean? Again, for SEDL to apply this principle,           would it mean there must be a strong connection to a theory of practice?         </li>      </ul>      <p><i>3. Use methods that permit direct investigation of the question </i></p>      <ul>        <li> What does “direct investigation” mean? </li>        <li> How do the constraints of resources (funding, time, people) impact           the selection of methods? Is so, what do we say about those constraints?         </li>        <li> How does the quantitative-qualitative distinction relate to this           principle? </li>        <li> Under what circumstances can descriptive methods be counted as scientific?         </li>        <li> Is there a continuum of the trustworthiness of evidence that is related           to the methods employed to gather it (e.g., from anecdotal to experimental           manipulation)? If so, what is it? </li>      </ul>      <p><i>4. Provide a coherent and explicit chain of reasoning </i></p>      <ul>        <li> To what does this apply (e.g., the connections between question,           evidence, and conclusion; the connections between findings, implications,           and applications)? </li>      </ul>      <p><i>5. Replicate and generalize across studies </i></p>      <ul>        <li> How does the notion of converging evidence relate to this principle?         </li>        <li> What is the role of contextual factors in dealing with replication?         </li>      </ul>      <p><i>6. Disclose research to encourage professional scrutiny and critique.         </i> </p>      <ul>        <li> How do ethics fit in this principle? </li>        <li> Does this principle adequately capture the notion of the social construction           of knowledge? </li>        <li> Does this principle entail explicitly stating all of the potential           sources of bias involved in conducting a scientific inquiry (e.g., political           agendas, theoretical camps, chains of reasoning, selection of methods,           the sponsor’s charge for the work)? </li>        <li> In professional scrutiny, who counts as a peer? </li>      </ul>      <p>Question 2: How do you think SEDL should attend to scientific research,         and the quality (or rigor) of it, in our work? What would we need to do         differently to act on scientific research in the manner you recommend?       </p>      <ul>        <li> SEDL should be explicit about the theoretical bases of our work and           should conduct institution-wide discussions to strengthen our collective           understanding of those theoretical bases (as well as the specifics of           the work itself) while focusing on our current core work in:           <ul>            <li> Improving school performance </li>            <li> Strengthening teaching and learning in content areas </li>            <li> Integrating technology into teaching and learning </li>            <li> Involving family and community in student learning </li>            <li> Connecting disability research to practice </li>            <li> Supporting policy development through research </li>          </ul>        </li>        <li> SEDL should develop complete programs of RD&D through these theoretical           bases and become more proactive in securing funding (both federal and           non-federal) to support and sustain those programs of work.</li>        <li> SEDL should review its current work to determine the extent to which           it is aligned with the principles of scientific research, including           our approach to professional development, our approach to working with           schools and practitioners, and our current research and evaluation projects.           SEDL should take steps to bring its work into alignment with these principles.         </li>        <li> The quality assurance process should apply the principles of scientific           research in its review parameters, should become institution wide, and           should begin at the conception of projects. </li>        <li> SEDL should promote and support with time and resources the publication           of its research in refereed journals. </li>        <li> SEDL’s work spans both research and practice; thus, we need competencies           in both. SEDL staff should understand and apply the principles of scientific           research to become better producers and consumers of research. </li>        <li> To increase staff understanding, SEDL should support an ongoing dialogue           between those who work primarily with assisting practitioners and those           who work primarily in conducting research. Ongoing professional development           should be provided in research methods and research practice with differing           amounts and depths of professional development being provided for staff           depending on their individual roles at SEDL. </li>        <li> SEDL should help practitioners (a) understand the principles of scientific           research to become better consumers of research, (b) understand how           to apply research findings in the context of the severe limitations           that most research studies express, and (c) make appropriate adaptations           of research findings given local contexts. </li>        <li> SEDL should help practitioners identify significant questions and           carry out “action research” following the principles of scientific research.         </li>        <li> Practitioners should help define appropriate research questions and           work with SEDL researchers. </li>        <li> SEDL should be better connected to the research community. </li>        <li> SEDL should determine how to benefit from scientifically based research           conducted outside the field of education (e.g., anthropology, sociology,           psychology, political science, economics). </li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 3: To be a successful RD&D institution, where success is         defined in terms of our ability to build knowledge and bring it to bear         on practice, are there other types of knowledge that we need to pay attention         to beyond that which comes from scientific research? If so, what are they,         how well do you think we attend to them, and what would we need to do         to better act on them? </b></p>      <p>Yes, there are other types of knowledge SEDL needs to pay attention to         as a producer and consumer/facilitator of scientific research. These other         types of knowledge include: </p>      <ul>        <li> Professional knowledge (found in best practice) </li>        <li> Community knowledge (beliefs and values) </li>        <li> Political knowledge </li>        <li> Procedural knowledge </li>        <li> Practical knowledge </li>        <li> Contextual knowledge </li>        <li> Conventional wisdom </li>        <li> Knowledge of personal interactions (e.g., team dynamics, relationship           building, trust building, motivation)</li>      </ul>      <p> SEDL recognizes the existence of these other types of knowledge but         does not consistently attend to them. In most cases, these other forms         of knowledge are held by individuals or sub-groups of staff. There is         no internal mechanism, procedure, or process to capture these forms of         knowledge so that they can be made available throughout SEDL’s RD&D operations.       </p>      <p>SEDL could better act on these other kinds of knowledge by </p>      <ul>        <ol>          <li> capturing and codifying this “collective wisdom” in a way that             reconciles best practice and scientific research and makes that information             broadly available within SEDL and across other relevant constituencies,             and </li>          <li> providing more staff training that addresses coherence between             scientific knowledge (associated with the six principles) and other             types of knowledge. </li>        </ol>      </ul>      <p><a href="http://www.sedl.org/staff/information/sciencebased/">Resource         Archive: Scientific Research in SEDL's Work</a></p>      <!--#include virtual="/staff/includes/footer.txt"-->
