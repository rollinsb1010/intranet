The synthesis         is organized around the five main questions addressed in the August 1         discussions.</p>      <p><b>Question 1: What did you learn from this session&#146;s readings that         changed your understandings of scientific research in education?</b></p>      <ul>        <li> Adhering to the principles of scientifically based research in practice           is complex. The six principles, while seemingly neutral when considered           in isolation, become subjective and open to question when applied in           real work. Even if you follow the six principles, you have not necessarily           arrived at the &#147;truth.&#148;</li>        <li> As a consumer and a producer of research, SEDL should consider the           important element of context. Context includes not only situational           variables, but also political pressures, resource constraints, and the           potential for bias to distort findings, which raises the following issues:           <ul>            <li> Those questions that are not best addressed through experimental               or quasi-experimental methods could be ignored under the current               political context. Principle 3 states that the methods used should               permit direct investigation of the research question and be appropriate               for the question being studied; the method should not have to be               experimental for a study to be scientifically based.</li>            <li> Even when there is support for a major study such as the National               Reading Panel (NRP) report, adequate resources in terms of time               and money may be lacking and may have an impact on what can be included               in the study.</li>            <li> Bias can come from many sources (e.g., political agendas, theoretical               camps, chains of reasoning, selection of methods, the sponsor&#146;s               charge for the work). The NRP report did not provide an explicit               chain of reasoning or a coherent explanation of the theory upon               which it was based.</li>          </ul>        </li>        <li> Professional critique and scrutiny are important. A more coherent           picture comes from looking at many peer-reviewed and replicated studies.</li>        <li> Questions remain about what &#147;scientific research in education&#148;           means. SEDL should revisit the six principles and determine exactly           what they mean to the institution as a whole; otherwise, different people           will interpret them in different ways.</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 2: Did this particular case lead you to change your thoughts         about any of the principles defining scientific research you felt were         important from your discussion in Session II? If so, how?</b></p>      <ul>        <li> In addition to the guiding principles for scientific inquiry in Scientific           Research in Education, the NRP should have followed the design principles           for fostering science in a federal education research agency to address           some of the problems panel members encountered in the NRP work; SEDL           should attend to these principles as well.</li>        <li> SEDL should better define the conditions under which descriptive           methods can be counted as scientific and be clear that scientific research           can include more that just experimental methods.</li>        <li> SEDL should explicitly state the assumptions underlying any scientific           endeavor.</li>        <li> SEDL staff need a clearer specification of the principles themselves           so the principles can better be applied in SEDL work.</li>        <li> A principle on ethics is also important in conducting scientific           research and would lead researchers to explicitly state such things           as the theoretical perspective being taken, the context of the work,           its limitations, statements concerning the availability of resources,           any mediating factors in its conduct, and political issues.</li>        <li> In conducting syntheses, one needs to be careful about whether the           procedures being employed are systematically dropping studies that do           not agree with the eventual outcome.</li>        <li> To reduce the influence of bias, peer review and replication are           critical aspects of conducting scientific research.</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 3: Would you change your responses to any of the other questions         you addressed in the previous session concerning SEDL&#146;s attention         to scientific research and other sources of knowledge based on your discussions         in this session? If so, what changes would you make?</b></p>      <ul>        <li> SEDL should create an operational definition of scientifically based           research, including a continuum of the trustworthiness of evidence (ranging           from anecdotal evidence to rigorous evidence obtained through experimental           evaluation).</li>        <li> SEDL should clarify how it will integrate the results of scientifically           based research into its dissemination activities (e.g., professional           development, technical assistance, and the provision of information).</li>        <li> SEDL needs to think about how to inform clients about (a) the application           of research findings given the severe limitations that most research           studies express and (b) appropriate and inappropriate adaptations of           findings in practice given local contexts.</li>        <li> SEDL should clarify and build upon current and previous work and           collect the relevant procedures and outcomes in an internal knowledge           base.</li>        <li> SEDL should examine and refine its quality assurance process to align           with the principles of scientifically based research. SEDL should include           peer review in that process.</li>        <li> SEDL should determine how to benefit from scientifically based research           conducted outside the field of education (e.g., anthropology, sociology,           psychology, political science, economics).</li>        <li> SEDL should define its research roles and priorities and secure more           resources to conduct scientifically based research appropriate to those           roles and priorities.</li>        <li> SEDL should clarify and standardize how the guiding principles of           scientific research will drive the organization's work. SEDL should           continue to provide staff development opportunities for staff to incorporate           these principles into their work.</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 4: Does the Session II synthesis accurately reflect your         group&#146;s discussion?</b></p>      <p>Most groups reported that the synthesis was accurate. In the cases where         there were additions, the synthesizers, when producing the refined Session         II synthesis, took these into consideration.</p>      <p><b>Question 5: Do you want to continue the dialogue on scientifically         based research via a listserv or a bulletin board?</b></p>      <p>Most groups said it was important to continue the face-to-face dialogue.         If this is done, then the electronic exchange (whether via bulletin board         or listserv) is less important. Thus, the synthesizers concluded that         we should not initiate an electronic exchange mechanism at this time,         but should reconsider it at a later time as these dialogues continue.</p>      <p><a href="http://www.sedl.org/staff/information/sciencebased/">Resource         Archive: Scientific Research in SEDL's Work</a></p>      <!--#include virtual="/staff/includes/footer.txt"-->
