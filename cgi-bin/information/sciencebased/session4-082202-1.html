However,         once the discussion began, the group agreed that the six principles are         dependent upon each other and could not be discussed individually. Additionally,         we wanted to focus our discussion on a holistic process rather than get         caught up in the semantics of the individual principles. The group instead         decided that it wanted to focus its discussion on the following:</p>      <p><b> 1. Why do we want to be a research institution? (to reaffirm purpose)         </b> </p>      <ol>        <ul>          <li> To help support our design and development effort.</li>          <li> To be &#147;field&#148; driven and not &#147;federal funds&#148;             driven.</li>          <li> To be identified around significant issues or arenas (i.e., important             questions).</li>          <li> To develop a reputation as an important research center as well             as a products and services organization (D&amp;D).</li>          <li> To develop research-based products, tools, and resources that can             be transferred to the field.</li>          <li> To engage in theory in the field.</li>        </ul>      </ol>      <p> We want to become much more than a research institution. We want to         become an institution that has the capacity to do research on and about         educational practices and contribute both original knowledge and practical         strategies based on research and validated by research to the field. This         is the niche that no one fills. It means working significantly differently         than a research institution like RAND. </p>      <p>We need research capacity along with development and dissemination capacity         to properly address the issues that confront educational systems, and         RD&amp;D together is a unique approach.</p>      <p><i>We don&#146;t know of any agencies that carry out ALL components of         RD&amp;D</i>.<a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></p>      <p> <b>2. How can we &#147;operationalize&#148; the six principles as a         coherent process at SEDL? That is, how would a &#147;research organization&#148;         be designed using the six principles as an organizational framework and         also using current or future funding resources? In what ways can we become         a research institution?</b></p>      <p>We should redesign our institution around significant questions such         as: &#147;How do we engage families and communities and schools in student         achievement?&#148; Once the work is designed around questions, then the         application of the six principles would take place, and then we could         answer Question 2.</p>      <p><b>3. How can we engage and coordinate resources to carry out work across         projects (significant questions) in a theory- and research-based environment?         Using our experience in the current organizational structure and culture,         how would/could this activity take place? </b></p>      <p>We feel the need to capitalize on the skills and expertise of ALL SEDL         staff. We have experts in research, development, and dissemination. Are         we currently asking staff to wear too many hats or work in other areas         besides their main expertise? </p>      <p><b>Recommended next steps </b></p>      <ul>        <li> Create a leadership team who could investigate other successful organizational           models of research organizations and present these models to the whole           staff for further discussion.</li>        <li> Draw upon the knowledge of organizational development experts. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></li>      </ul>      <a name="group2">       <h4>Group 2</h4>      </a>       <p><b>Members present:</b> Sean Claes, Johanna Franke (recorder), Cori Groth,         Wes Hoover, Kim Hughes (reporter), Patricia Keith, Vangie Orozco (facilitator),         Sue Street (synthesizer)</p>      <p><b>Question 1: Does the Session III synthesis accurately reflect your         group&#146;s August 1 discussion? If not, what would you change?</b><br>        <br>        Yes. The group discussed Bullet 1 of Question 3 (SEDL should create an         operational definition of scientifically based research, including a continuum         of the trustworthiness of evidence) to clarify its meaning. </p>      <p><b>Question 2: Does the refined Session II-III synthesis accurately reflect         your group&#146;s discussions?

Is it the same as &#147;important&#148;?         Does it mean &#147;complex&#148; as opposed to &#147;simple&#148;? For         SEDL, would the application of this principle mean that there must be         a strong connection to education practice?</i></p>      <p>A &#147;significant&#148; question:</p>      <ul>        <li> Has a clear application to SEDL work and a clear application to improving           student learning (e.g., we don&#146;t want to ask, &#147;Do classes           of three promote student achievement more than classes of five?&#148;           as the answer to this question is difficult to apply in our region).</li>        <li> Addresses problems that are widespread and persistent in SEDL&#146;s           region.</li>        <li> Results in practical applications, allowing for &#147;more bang for           the buck.&#148;</li>        <li> Creates new knowledge or fills a gap in existing knowledge.</li>      </ul>      <p>Significant questions are the questions we hear again and again. They         are timely and they have momentum. They need to parallel SEDL&#146;s capacity         to answer them.</p>      <p>While the above criteria and SEDL&#146;s six focus areas may serve as         guides to screen significant questions, we should not pass up opportunities         that do not necessarily adhere to these criteria and SEDL focus areas.</p>      <p><b>Principle 2: Link research to relevant theory.</b></p>      <p><i>What does &#147;relevant&#148; mean? Again, for SEDL to apply this         principle, would it mean there must be a strong connection to a theory         of practice?</i></p>      <p>Group members thought there was more misunderstanding around &#147;theory&#148;         than &#147;relevant&#148; in this principle. Theories are stable explanations         of phenomena that generalize beyond particular cases. A relevant theory:</p>      <ul>        <li> Can be operationalized in the field.</li>        <li> Has an overarching framework (that researchers make explicit) within           which hypotheses are posed. (You don&#146;t just ask questions to collect           facts; you must link questions back to the theoretical framework that           drives the scientific inquiry.) </li>        <li> Can be tested, measured, observed, and linked to others&#146; theories&#151;not           just your own ideas.<br>          Literature reviews are one way SEDL can develop research questions and           relevant theory. <br>          Group members discussed the REL&#146;s &#147;cube theory&#148; and how           it is challenging to develop theory and test it at the same time.<a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></li>      </ul>      <p><b>Principle 3: Use methods that permit direct investigation of the question.</b></p>      <p><i>What does &#147;direct investigation&#148; mean?

Is there a continuum of trustworthiness         of evidence that is related to the methods employed to gather it?</i></p>      <p>Direct investigation means explicitly delineating a logical chain of         reasoning (see Principle 4: Provide a coherent and explicit chain of reasoning)         that links the question to the method. The direct link between the method         and the problem/question allows you to develop this chain of reasoning.</p>      <p>Descriptive methods are scientific when reliable data collection methods         are used (e.g., instruments and observation results are reliable; procedures         are systematic).</p>      <p><b>Question 4: You made a number of recommendations concerning how SEDL         should attend to scientific research, and the quality (or rigor) of it,         in our work.

Some         suggested our time would be better spent preparing for future contracts/work.         Others said we might draw better conclusions for our current work using         these principles even if we can&#146;t change our methods to adhere to         them. </p>      <p><b>Question 5: You listed a number of other types of knowledge that SEDL         needed to pay attention to as a producer and consumer of scientific research         (see Question 3).
