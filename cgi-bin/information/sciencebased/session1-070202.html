When the larger group reconvened, staff         members expressed the following.</p>      <h4>I. Political background of scientifically based research </h4>      <ol>        <li> Began in the 1980s when congressmen saw a disconnect between research           and its application. The Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration (CSRD)           program was created to fill that gap, but, to this day, the program           includes little scientifically based research. </li>        <li> When Bush was governor of Texas, he advocated for a phonics approach           to reading in the phonics vs. whole-language reading wars because the           phonics program was much more strongly supported by scientifically based           research. </li>        <li> When Bush became president, the Bush administration expanded the           scientifically based approach beyond reading into many other education           areas (where there isn’t as much scientific evidence) through the No           Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA). </li>        <li> OERI assistant secretary Grover Whitehurst has said that education           practice is 10 percent evidence-based and 90 percent wisdom-based; he           wants to see the exact opposite. </li>        <li> The Clinton administration didn’t enforce Title I requirements to           base practice on scientifically based research; the Bush administration           is saying it will enforce them. The Bush administration’s first attempt           to do this is through Reading First. Though federal agencies cannot           dictate curricula, they can put pressure on the states by not granting           funding to those that don’t incorporate scientifically based curricula           in their schools. </li>        <li> In NCLBA, there are more than 100 mentions of scientifically based           research. </li>      </ol>      <h4>II. Definition of scientifically based research </h4>      <ol>        <li> Staff need to know exactly what “scientifically based research” means           before they can determine the impact of this type of research on their           work.           <ul>            <li> No matter what kind of research it is—even if it’s scientific—you               can have good and bad research. The quality of research is something               we should consider in our work. </li>            <li> Convergent evidence also should be considered in our work. There               are some bodies of knowledge with a lot of research evidence and               there are some bodies of knowledge with little research evidence.               In our work, we should understand the difference. <br>            </li>          </ul>        </li>        <li> The Department of Education’s empirically based research definition           may be too narrow.           <ul>            <li> The funding for the kind of quality and involvement necessary               to produce scientifically based research is not there in many places.             </li>            <li> To remain competitive for federal funding, we need to know what               scientifically based research is and how to use it—top-down pressure.             </li>          </ul>        </li>        <li> Spoken definition of scientifically based research does not match           written definition. </li>        <li> How do we express what is important for students through definition           of scientifically based research?           <ul>            <li> Research is about not <i>knowing</i> something. We need to have               a verifiable way of <i>learning</i>. As educators, we’re experts               in knowing, but we need to be experts in learning. </li>          </ul>        </li>        <li> Figuring out the role of scientifically based research in our work           will help us think about what it is that SEDL is doing in general. </li>        <li> We need to think about how scientifically based research impacts           SEDL’s different functions: research, development, and dissemination.           <ul>            <li> Different staff members have different levels of expertise in               R, D, and D. . </li>          </ul>        </li>        <li>Are we coming up with a political definition for scientifically based           research for the federal administration? No, we are not determining           what the administration thinks scientifically based research is. We           need a principled response for SEDL.</li>        <li> The National Research Council, in the book Scientific Research in           Education, is tying to establish a set of principles.           <ul>            <li> Will it do it successfully? </li>            <li> Will we be able to tell our clients what is good science? </li>            <li> And what are the other sources of knowledge besides science we               should turn to? </li>          </ul>        </li>        <li> We don’t need a broad scientifically based definition of what works,           but rather what works specifically for what groups of learners at what           points in time and in what contexts.           <ul>            <li> A lot of our work is at the organizational level, not the individual               level. </li>            <li> We need to be skilled at determining whether certain scientifically               based research applies to a certain client’s situation. </li>          </ul>        </li>      </ol>      <h4>III. SEDL research in the field </h4>      <ol>        <li> How are we going to conduct research in the field if schools are           allowed to only use scientifically based programs? How do we engage           in the process of doing science with them? </li>            <li><b> Credibility </b>        <ul>          <li> We understand that credibility is important, but our clients aren’t             as interested in research-based methods as much as how we can help             them. We need to understand the balance between the two. </li>          <li> Practitioners in the field want to know where our programs have             been used before and how they worked. They don’t want to do the research,             but they want to know where it’s been done and the results of it.           </li>            <li> We’ve got very different people going to very different sites,               so individual findings are very important (see Scientific Principle               5, “Replicate and Generalize Across Studies,” <i><a href="http://www.nap.edu/books/0309082919/html/">Scientific               Research in Education</a></i>, pp.70-72). Clients are interested               in validation of our work across sites. </li>          <li> We also need to look at new strategies we’re producing. </li>          <li> Clients are interested in what is research based, so we have a             duty to respond to that. </li>        </ul></li>     <li><b> Competitiveness </b>           <ul>            <li> To remain competitive for federal funding, we need to know what               scientifically based research is and how to use it. </li>            <li> We also need to know what science is already out there so we               can build on it. </li>          </ul>        </li>		        <li> <b>Peer review and publishing</b>           <ul>		  <li> We need more opportunities to publish           our research. </li>            <li> We need to know how to conduct peer reviews, internally and externally,               of scientifically based research. </li>          </ul>        </li>        <li> <b>Research design </b><ul>            <li> As a research institution, how do we construct a scientifically               based design/proposal? </li>            <li> The design/proposal needs to include what we measure (reliability               and validity) and how we analyze our research (qualitative measurements/interviews               are as important as number crunching). </li>          </ul>        </li>     <li> <b>Fairness and accountability </b>           <ul>            <li> Using control groups is not fair to students who don’t receive               the treatment. Students are people, not laboratory rats. </li>            <li> Schools are being judged by one-point tests. </li>            <li> SEDL doesn’t use control groups. </li>          </ul>        </li>      </ol>      <p>At the end of this discussion, Wes reviewed SEDL’s next three scientifically   based research sessions using the handout “Outline: The Role of Scientific Research   in SEDL’s Work.” Then the larger group split into six smaller groups defined   by the handout “Group Assignments.” Groups selected a facilitator, recorder,   reporter, and synthesizer for the next three sessions and determined whether   to read Chapter 6 in <i><a href="http://www.nap.edu/books/0309082919/html/">Scientific   Research in Education</a></i>, “Design Principles for Fostering Science in a   Federal Education Research Agency,” which Wes said was voluntary. The rest of   the book is to be read by the next scientifically based research session on   July 22. </p><p><a href="http://www.sedl.org/staff/information/sciencebased/">Resource Archive:   Scientific Research in SEDL's Work</a></p>            <!--#include virtual="/staff/includes/footer.txt"-->
