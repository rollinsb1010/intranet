An external         evaluator was hired to accomplish this task. The discussion sessions took         place on July 2, July 22, August 1, and August 22 of 2002, and the general         focus planned for each session was as follows: </p>      <blockquote>         <p><b>Session 1</b> &#150; Introduction </p>        <p><b>Session 2</b> &#150; Discussion of the general principles of scientifically-based           research as set out in the book, Scientific Research in Education, written           by members of the National Research Council and published in 2002</p>        <p><b>Session 3</b> &#150; Discussion of the application of the general           principles of scientific research to a particular educational issue:           the acquisition of reading skills</p>        <p><b>Session 4</b> &#150; Discussion of what position SEDL should take           regarding scientific research in education</p>      </blockquote>      <p>With the exception of Session 1 (which was considerably shorter), each         session lasted approximately 4 hours and all SEDL professional staff (except         those in personnel and the business office) and Dana Center staff working         at SEDL were invited to attend. In addition, several temporary Fellows         were included in the work groups, as well as one person working with SEDL         staff members on REL Task 1 work. The total number of staff members invited         to attend the sessions was 84 (67 SEDL, 10 Dana Center, six Fellows, and         one external)†. These 84 people were assigned to one of six groups, each         composed of individuals working in a variety of programmatic areas, and         each containing individuals working in various position levels in the         organization (i.e., managers, associates, specialists, and assistants).         <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a> </p>      <p>Tables 1 and 2 below provide specific information about session attendance.</p>      <p><b><font color="#666666">Table 1.

Contacted         individuals were asked if they preferred to participate in a focus group         or an individual interview, and were scheduled accordingly. The final         sample of respondents who provided data for this report consisted of 22         people, 14 of whom participated in one of two focus group discussions,         and eight who were interviewed individually by the evaluator. This group         of evaluation participants was comprised of nine program associates and         12 program specialists representing various programmatic work areas at         SEDL and one person affiliated with the Dana Center. Data were collected         within a one week period from September 26 to October 2, 2002. Most of         the interviews lasted about an hour, with the shortest being 45 minutes         and the longest an hour and a half. Both focus group discussions were         an hour and a half in length. For the purposes of this report, focus group         participants will not be differentiated from individual interviewees &#150;         all will be referred to using terms such as &quot;respondent,&quot; &quot;participant,&quot;         or &quot;interviewee,&quot; and in no case will individuals be identified         by name or specific programmatic work group.</p>      <p>The same general questions were addressed to all participants, whether         they participated in focus groups or interviews (a list of the questions         used is provided at the end of this report). The protocol was divided         into questions on three general topics: 1) the specific professional development         sessions on scientific research, 2) results of participation in these         sessions, and 3) if and how to continue this general type of professional         development for SEDL staff. These three subject groupings will be used         to organize the findings discussion in the following section. The purpose         of this report is to convey a general sense of the way those who participated         in the evaluation responded to questions in these three areas. A more         detailed discussion of various points emphasized by some or all of the         respondents will be provided to Wes Hoover, who initiated both the overall         activity and this evaluation. Confidentiality and participants' anonymity         will be respected in any discussions that might take place. <a href="#page_up">         [ UP ]</a> </p>      <h4>Findings</h4>      <p><b>Feedback on Discussion Sessions </b></p>      <p><b>Content. </b>The stated objectives for the three primary discussion         sessions for this activity were as follows:</p>      <table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4" align="center">        <tr>          <td width="21%">Objective 1</td>          <td width="79%">            <p>To improve our understanding of what scientific research in education               is</p>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td width="21%" valign="top">Objective 2</td>          <td width="79%" valign="top">             <p>To improve our understanding of the role of scientific research               in our overall R&amp;D endeavor</p>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td width="21%" valign="top">Objective 3</td>          <td width="79%" valign="top">             <p>To develop a position statement on the role that scientific research               in education will play in SEDL's work</p>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>When asked if these objectives had been met, there was a near consensus         among those who provided feedback for this evaluation: that the first         objective had been achieved, that the second had been only partially achieved,         and that the third had not been achieved. Most respondents' general satisfaction         with specific sessions declined somewhat over the course of the overall         activity; they seemed most satisfied with Session 2, less so with Session         3, and least satisfied with Session 4.</p>      <p>Discussions in Session 2 were specifically centered on the book, Scientific         Research in Education, that had been provided to everyone for review in         preparation for the overall, multi-session activity. This clear and narrow         focus enabled participants to stay on track and to feel certain about         what was expected of them. Although most respondents said that their understanding         of scientific research was still incomplete, everyone said that they came         out of Session 2 with a better understanding than they had going in. One         thing that did affect progress in Session 2 discussions was the fact that         participants' research knowledge and skill levels varied so widely. Several         people said that rather than focusing specifically on scientifically-based         research, their group spent a lot of time talking about research more         generally (e.g., the difference between qualitative and quantitative methods,         the definition of specific terms such as replication) because some members         of the group had little or no research training or experience. This is         an inevitable consequence of involving such a broad and mixed group in         discussions on a somewhat specialized topic, but not necessarily a negative         one. Several researchers who were interviewed said that they were able         to take a lead in the discussions and others who knew very little about         research said that they enjoyed learning more about it. This difference         in skill levels did, however, impede the progress of at least some groups         in fully meeting the first objective in Session 2, and their discussions         on this topic spilled over into other sessions. In reference to this problem,         one respondent said, &quot;We really stayed on this [objective] the whole         time,&quot; and this left inadequate time to fully address the remaining         objectives in Sessions 3 and 4. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a> </p>      <p>Participants who attended Session 3 were generally pleased with the application         of scientific research to the specific case of reading. Although the vast         majority did not have a background in the field of reading, most reported         that the printed materials provided before the session gave them enough         context to be able to apply some of the broader ideas covered in Session         2. There was less satisfaction, however, when the discussion shifted to         how to apply the principles of scientific research to SEDL's overall work         (Objective 2). As one person put it: &quot;There's a big shift between         'what is [scientific research]?' and 'what do we do with it?' We didn't         get far enough on the first question to address the second.&quot; Participants         who did not have experience in research generally did not feel ready to         address this question, since they were still grappling with understanding         what scientific research was. One result of moving into this area too         early was that many of the suggestions that various groups made about         what could be done at SEDL were described as &quot;too detailed&quot;         and sometimes &quot;off task.&quot; Several people said that the lists         generated in Session 3 were more like &quot;wish lists,&quot; rather than         suggestions based on a clear understanding of the larger issues. Another         issue mentioned by several respondents was that they were being asked         to discuss how to apply the principles of scientific research to SEDL's         work before there was an agreement about whether or not this should be         done. For various reasons, then, the majority of respondents felt like         the question of how to apply SBR to SEDL's work was posed prematurely         &#150; they didn't feel ready to discuss this in Session 3, and in some         cases, not even in Session 4. The idea of being able to develop a position         statement for SEDL (Objective 3) was even more remote. </p>      <p>A significant number of the respondents said that it would have helped         to have had more clarity from the beginning about exactly what was expected         from the overall activity (e.g., What was the rationale for or purpose         of this activity? Was it to serve simply as an academic exercise and background         information for staff, or was actual implementation the ultimate goal?         If the latter, what was the expected time frame for changes? How would         staff input be used by the leadership at SEDL?). In general, many people         seemed unclear about overall expectations for the activity, so they were         uncertain about the role they were to play as staff members participating         in these discussions. Some suggested that these issues could have been         addressed more fully in Session 1. <a href="#page_up">         [ UP ]</a></p>      <p><b>Format.</b> Respondents were generally very pleased with the format         of the discussion sessions. They appreciated the opportunity to interact         with staff members from different programmatic work groups and said that         this gave them an opportunity to learn more about both people and work         in different areas at SEDL. The format of using predominantly small group         discussions for the activity was also viewed positively, and respondents         thought the groups were about the right size (two people said that small         groups used for this type of discussion should not have more than ten         people). Nearly everyone thought it was a good idea to keep membership         in the discussion groups consistent throughout all of the sessions, although         a few people said it might be good to move people around in future activities         that might involve more than four total sessions. In this activity, having         consistent groups seemed to create a coherence of discussion that was         seen as valuable, and some people said this made it easier to &quot;pick         up where they left off&quot; in the next session. One exception to this         general arrangement was that several people thought that Wes should move         around and participate in the discussions of all of the groups at different         times. Most evaluation participants who were assigned to the group Wes         was a part of thought that having him present for discussions and available         for questions was an advantage.</p>      <p>Another aspect of the activity that respondents were asked to comment         on was the development of a synthesis following Sessions 2, 3, and 4.         Each group wrote up a summary of their discussion in each session and         then a smaller group of volunteers wrote an overall description synthesizing         the major points discussed by all of the groups following each session.         These syntheses were then made available to all participants on SEDL's         intranet. Nearly everyone who participated in this evaluation thought         that the syntheses were useful and recommended using this approach in         future staff development activities at SEDL. It provided a good &quot;connector&quot;         between sessions, and many people said that they used it as a way to prepare         for upcoming sessions. Others said that they read the synthesis when they         were unable to attend a particular session, and it gave them an idea of         what they had missed. Suggestions for improving the syntheses included:         using a narrative format, rather than just bulleted lists; adding a more         interpretative component, rather than just a summary of details; &quot;saying         more about less&quot; (e.g., distill the discussions into the three most         important points discussed by various groups); and incorporating points         made in the whole-group discussions that occurred at the end of each session.         Posting the completed syntheses on the intranet was generally seen as         a good dissemination approach for SEDL staff, and the fact that hard copies         were made available to non-SEDL participants (e.g., Dana Center staff)         was appreciated. <a href="#page_up">         [ UP ]</a></p>      <p><b>Results of Participation</b></p>      <p>In response to a general question about what they had gotten out of participating         in this activity, most interviewees said that their awareness of, and         knowledge about, SBR had increased. A few said that the issue had come         up in programmatic work group discussions, and others mentioned that it         was beneficial for SEDL staff members to have developed a common vocabulary         and framework for talking about the whole issue of SBR. Researchers who         were interviewed generally reported that their current work was validated         by the approach to SBR presented in the book used to guide the discussions         in Session 2. Several also mentioned being relieved to know that SEDL's         research work did not have to be bound by a very narrow definition of         SBR. A more general result of the activity mentioned by several people         was that meeting as a whole group to discuss any topic has the desired         affect of unifying the staff at SEDL, especially across work groups.</p>      <p>When asked specifically if their work had been directly affected by their         participation in this activity, respondents reported little or no change.         There were two primary reasons given for this. First, as discussed above,         discussions of direct applications to SEDL's work were the weakest aspect         of the activity. Many of the respondents did not feel ready to address         this question and although some possibilities for change were submitted         in Sessions 3 and 4, people did not feel that they had been acted upon         yet. Second, and perhaps more significantly, the majority of respondents         felt that opportunities to alter their current work were limited because         of the requirements of current funding contracts. Their general assumption         was that these discussions of SBR were more likely to affect future work         at SEDL than presently funded work, since a strong emphasis on SBR would         have to be more specifically written into proposals for new work. Another         common assumption was that SEDL is more reactive than proactive in its         search for funding sources, so it would not do any good for the institution         to take a strong stand on the issue of SBR unless such a stand reflected         the position of those who most frequently granted funding to the organization         (in particular, the U.S. Department of Education). Since they were unclear         about what major funding sources were thinking along these lines, many         had adopted more of an attitude of &quot;wait and see what they're going         to fund,&quot; especially in regards to future REL and technology contracts.         In general, while many respondents saw the potential for significant changes         in SEDL's work as a result of having a strong commitment to the principles         of SBR, most thought that whether or not this potential was developed         depended on a variety of contextual factors. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP         ]</a> </p>      <p><b>Future Professional Development Planning</b></p>      <p>No one who was interviewed for this evaluation thought that SEDL's work         on the issue of SBR was complete, and all thought that it was important         to take further steps to create some type of closure on the activity.         There was less agreement on what such a &quot;closure&quot; would look         like. For many, it was to continue the discussions in order to develop         consensus on a formal position statement for the organization on this         issue (Objective 3). Others were less focused on the position statement         specifically, but felt strongly that something &quot;concrete,&quot; &quot;tangible,&quot;         or &quot;practical&quot; should result from the time that had spent in         more theoretical discussions of SBR. The common idea here was the need         for some form of follow-through. For many respondents, what such further         activities would indicate was that the leadership at SEDL was committed         to organizational change and that the input from staff members had been         taken seriously.</p>      <p>When asked for specific suggestions about what the &quot;next steps&quot;         for the SBR activity should be, nearly everyone said that it was most         appropriate for the discussions to be continued in smaller groups, rather         than to continue meeting as an entire staff. Ideas about the composition         of these &quot;smaller groups&quot; included: programmatic work groups,         SEDL managers, the synthesis team, an advisory team of staff and management         volunteers who were interested in discussing SBR further, and people at         SEDL who had research training and were actually doing research work now.         Most respondents thought that the focus of these further discussions should         be fairly concrete to define specific outcomes (e.g., how the principles         of SBR could be used in SEDL's work), and that further developments resulting         from these discussions should ultimately be shared with the broader group.       </p>      <p>Looking beyond the specific issue of SBR and this particular staff development         effort, the majority of the respondents were generally supportive of the         approach to staff development used in this activity (e.g., all-staff participation,         small group discussions on specific topics relevant to the organization)         and thought it was a good use of their time. However, most said that they         would only be interested in participating in future activities of this         type under certain conditions. Those most frequently mentioned were: 1)         if they thought that the topics discussed were relevant to their work,         and 2) if such discussions produced some kind of tangible results. The         first condition was related to general interest and applicability, while         the second had more to do with seeing evidence of follow-through and a         clarification of the role of staff in organizational decision-making at         SEDL. <a href="#page_up">         [ UP ]</a></p>      <p>When asked what specific topics would be good to focus on in similar         (i.e., all staff) professional development activities in the future at         SEDL, respondents' suggestions varied widely, but generally fell into         two categories: those involving internal organizational issues and those         focusing on SEDL's relationship to external clients and potential funding         sources. In the case of the former, specific topics suggested included         (in order of frequency): developing an overall plan to better define the         direction SEDL wants to go in its work, clarification about the organizational         leadership model used at SEDL, discussions about creating better integration         across the organization (i.e., between work groups), improving communication         skills within the organization, and clarification of the organization's         position on a variety of specific issues (e.g., diversity, literacy, and         approaches to staff development). In the area of external issues, the         biggest concern was about the topic of funding opportunities and how SEDL         can become more proactive in seeking future funding. Other suggestions         included discussion of specific &quot;education topics&quot; encountered         in the field, such as teacher quality and accountability, and the implications         of various developments in Washington for SEDL's work. Overall, respondents         seemed interested in participating in this type of discussion, but recognized         the difficulty of finding a topic that was broad or global enough to engage         all SEDL staff members.</p>      <p>Most people said that they could feasibly spend 1/2 to one full day a         month in this kind of staff development activity. While some thought that         the time would be best spent in longer, more intensive discussion sessions         (i.e., 1-3 consecutive days), the majority of respondents said that single,         four-hour or full-day sessions would be better for them. Many people said         that the likelihood of their participation would be increased if they         knew about any planned professional development activities four to six         months in advance. Others emphasized that it would be best if this type         of activity became more a part of their regular work routine on a monthly         basis, rather than being planned on an unpredictable, short-notice basis.       </p>      <p>Everyone interviewed thought that the small group discussion format used         in this activity was a good approach and favored using a similar approach         in future activities. Several people also mentioned that they thought         having specific readings to review in advance of discussion sessions was         a good idea that should be used again. This allowed them to come to discussions         more prepared and established a common vocabulary for the discussion group         to use during the activity. <a href="#page_up">         [ UP ]</a> </p>      <h4>Conclusions and Recommendations</h4>      <p><b>Sessions on SBR</b></p>      <p>Overall, the discussions of scientific research in education conducted         in July and August of this year were well received. Although this work         is not yet complete, progress toward achieving the three stated objectives         was made. As a result of their experience in this activity, most respondents         reported that they would be interested in participating in future activities         of this type. The following recommendations for use in planning future         staff development activities are drawn from the feedback received from         participants in this evaluation.</p>      <ul>        <li> Continue assigning staff to small discussion groups with members           from different work groups within the lab. However, be aware that having           such mixed groups may slow the pace of discussions and the rate at which           objectives can be met. Moving to discussions of implementation may be           especially difficult, given the different experiences of various staff           members, so allow adequate time for this. Also, it was beneficial to           have consistent group membership throughout the activity, but consider           having Wes (or leaders of future activities) circulate among the various           groups.</li>        <li> Continue providing materials for participants to review prior to           meeting. This approach worked well to help people prepare for discussions           and to provide a common vocabulary and framework for sharing ideas on           the assigned topics.</li>        <li> Continue writing session syntheses. While admittedly time-consuming,           this aspect of the SBR activity was generally well received. The majority           of respondents said that the synthesis paper from one session helped           them to prepare for the next. Consider alternative formats and contents           for these papers to maximize their usefulness.</li>        <li> Consider repeating the approach of applying abstract principles to           a specific case in other trainings. </li>      </ul>      <p>Respondents reported that using the example of reading acquisition in         Session 3 was helpful. <a href="#page_up">         [ UP ]</a></p>      <p><b>Results of Participation</b></p>      <p>Specific results of participation were fairly limited at the time data         were collected. Awareness and knowledge levels about SBR were generally         increased, but there were few reported changes in participants' work as         a result of the activity. Most attributed this to the fact that more work         (i.e., follow-up) is needed in this area.</p>      <ul>        <li> Take contextual factors into account in planning desired outcomes.           Both internal factors at SEDL and external factors (especially those           having to do with funding) need to be considered in defining expected           results from activities such as this one. </li>        <li> Follow through with the work on SBR to assist SEDL staff and managers           in accomplishing desired results. It may be that the first step to take           in this follow-up work is to convene a smaller team of interested individuals           to discuss next steps, or to encourage this type of discussion in established           programmatic work groups. In either case, continue to communicate with           the larger group about ongoing work that is accomplished.</li>        <li> Consider emphasizing a greater organizational commitment to SBR in           future funding proposals. Many respondents reported feeling limited           by current contract obligations and thought that if major changes in           work at SEDL were to take place, they would happen in new, not present           work. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a> </li>      </ul>      <p><b>Future Professional Development Planning</b></p>      <p>Generally, respondents showed an interest in participating in this type         of all-staff professional development approach again in the future. Some         lessons learned from this experience that may help in planning future         activities include:</p>      <ul>        <li> Be clearer about overall motivations for and expectations of this           type of professional development activity from the beginning. It would           be especially useful to clarify whether the activity is for informational           and educational purposes, as opposed to there being expectations for           changes in policy as a result of the work done. If work or policy changes           are expected, provide a proposed timeline for such changes and build           in time to discuss possible &quot;next steps&quot; at the end of the           activity.</li>        <li> When choosing a topic, make sure that it is global enough to engage           all participants. This is more difficult to do with specific substantive           issues, but this type of professional development seems ideal for discussing           internal organizational issues that affect staff members' work. It may           also be that spending some time working in this area would prepare the           way for more productive sessions on narrower, substantive topics.</li>        <li> Plan future sessions in advance and notify potential participants           as early as possible. Staff members are willing to spend from one-half           to one full day per month engaged in this type of activity, but advance           planning (ideally four to six months advanced notice) would increase           the likelihood that they could participate. Attendance might also be           improved if this type of activity became more a part of the normal routine           for staff at SEDL. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a> </li>      </ul>      <p><b>Questions Used for Interviews and Focus Groups</b></p>      <p>I.
