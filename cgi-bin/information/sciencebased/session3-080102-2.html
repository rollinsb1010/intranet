If so, how?</b></p>      <p>This case led us to identify several issues that are important to consider         about the implementation of the principles:</p>      <ul>        <li> Importance of ethics in implementing research</li>        <li> Ideal vs. actual implementation</li>        <li> Political agendas do come into play in the process</li>        <li> Resources, or lack thereof, influence to what degree one can truly           implement the principles</li>        <li> Importance of peer review</li>        <li> Science cannot be completely objective, so peer review must be implemented           throughout the process. It is especially important at the beginning           of the process because in formulating important questions, it is key           that more points of view come into play. </li>        <li> The impact of scientific research principles on the field of education           may have profound effects</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 3: Would you change your responses to any of the other questions         you addressed in the previous session concerning SEDL&#146;s attention         to scientific research and other sources of knowledge based on your discussions         in this session?

If so, how?</b></p>      <ul>        <li> The readings supported the idea that some principles need to be described           more&#151;that would leave them less open to interpretation and bias.</li>        <li> We still have a concern that scientific research should go beyond           experimental research only.</li>        <li> Political or personal agendas can drive what gets studied and emphasized           resulting in biased outcomes.</li>        <li> Advocates for alternative points of view have not done their homework.</li>        <li> We need to remember that even in the most empirical approach, the           act of conducting the research itself has an impact on the outcome.</li>        <li> Research is not the whole truth and any attempt to call something           fixed and final is flawed.</li>        <li> Since no research in itself is perfect, replication and reliability           plays an important role in reducing bias.</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 3: Would you change your responses to any of the other questions         you addressed in the previous session concerning SEDL&#146;s attention         to scientific research and other sources of knowledge based on your discussions         in this session? If so, what changes would you make?</b></p>      <ul>        <li> SEDL needs to be aware of the body of research behind any work we           do or ideas that we advocate as well as know its limitations and our           own biases that we bring to the work.</li>        <li> We need to spend more time on the significant questions that drive           our research rather than on political agendas.</li>        <li> The debate on topics is healthy&#151;it&#146;s important to look           at opposing views and synthesize the findings as best we can.</li>        <li> What criteria are SEDL using to determine what research we use to           drive our work?</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 4: Does the Session II synthesis accurately reflect your         group&#146;s discussion?</b></p>      <ul>        <li> Question 2, Bullet 1: We not only need to strengthen our collective           understanding about our work in general but the specific work we are           doing in each project.</li>        <li> Question 2, Bullet 2: Add that SEDL should become proactive in securing           a variety of funding sources beyond federal funding.</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 5: Do you want to continue the dialogue on scientifically         based research via a listserv or a bulletin board?</b></p>      <p>The group felt that the face-to-face discussions about scientifically         based research were more valuable than an electronic forum. Our experiences         with electronic formats show that very few people respond unless there         is a real passion or an immediate driving need for the subject. Our current         work keeps our time more than full with responding to other priorities.</p>      <p><b>Additional notes from the discussion:</b></p>      <p>A few of the articles responding to the NRP report expressed a concern         that there was a political agenda driving the report as evidenced by how         the members of the NRP were selected and how the criteria used was slanted         toward the inclusion of skills-based programs and not other approaches         to reading.</p>      <p>The NRP report seemed to be a good example of how to use the six principles,         but it also raised some questions.<a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a> </p>      <a name="group3">       <h4>Group 6</h4>      </a>       <p><b>Group members present:</b> Suzanne Ashby, Laurie Born (synthesizer),         Jackie Burniske, Nikki Hanegan (recorder/reporter), Joyce Pollard, Rowena         Tolentino (fellow), Jeannine Turner, Eric Waters (facilitator), Sebastian         Wren</p>      <p><b>Question 1: What did you learn from this session&#146;s readings that         changed your understanding of scientific research in education?</b></p>      <p>The assigned readings didn&#146;t change our understandings about scientific         research in education. They DID serve to heighten our awareness of those         policy decisions that narrow the focus of research and the implications         of those decisions. The readings highlighted the importance of looking         beyond policy reports to explore the broad spectrum of research available         on an issue. </p>      <p>We need to distinguish between primary research and secondary sources.         Primary research/original research is seldom done at SEDL due to time         constraints and project priorities.</p>      <p>Our discussion turned to the question of implementation methods and the         &#147;black box&#148; in which researched interventions take place. Who         actually conducts the instructional intervention? Does that impact the         intervention outcomes? We know that the effect rating decreases as the         intervention is handed down from the primary researcher to other practitioners.         How can factors that reduce the effectiveness of instructional intervention         be controlled? In controlling these research interventions, do we, in         effect, make teachers into puppets, rather than allowing them to adapt         the approach to better fit the context in which they are providing instruction?         How do we impress upon teachers the importance of following a protocol         when implementing research programs?</p>      <p><b>Question 2: Did this particular case lead you to change your thoughts         about any of the principles defining scientific research you felt were         important from your discussion in Session II?

If so, what changes would you make?</b></p>      <p>We realized that we need to be more conscious of how we report our work         to the public. SEDL needs to operationalize external peer review, publish         in journals, etc.</p>      <p>This turned into a discussion of how/whether SEDL&#146;s approach to         professional development could be structured as an experimental research         project.<a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a> </p>      <p><a href="session3-080102-1.html">Groups 1-3</a></p>      <p><a href="http://www.sedl.org/staff/information/sciencebased/">Resource         Archive: Scientific Research in SEDL's Work</a></p>      <!--#include virtual="/staff/includes/footer.txt"-->
