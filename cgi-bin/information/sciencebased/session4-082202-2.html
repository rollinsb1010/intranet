If not, what would you change? </b></p>      <p>The group felt this synthesis was accurate. We request that the examples         listed under sources of bias include value systems. </p>      <p><b>Question 2: Does the refined Session II-III synthesis accurately reflect         your group’s discussions? If not, what would you change? </b></p>      <p>Principle 6: Our group suggested that this process should not wait until         the end of the process. Using the word “disclose” seems to limit the process         to the end. </p>      <p>Principle 1: We also asked what does empirical mean? We felt the principles         were not to be applied in a linear fashion, but other groups disagreed.         Should the introduction to this section include that disagreement? In         addition, the principles seem neutral in the text, but the application         of them is messy. We should use the other types of knowledge to inform         questions that would be investigated scientifically. </p>      <p><b>Question 3: Pick at least three principles about which your group         has the greatest concern and address the questions posed under those principles         by either answering them or proposing ways in which they could be answered         (be specific and concrete). </b></p>      <p><b>Principle 1: Pose significant questions that can be investigated empirically.         </b> </p>      <p><I>What does “significant” mean? Is it the same as “important”? Does         it mean “complex” as opposed to “simple”?

It does           not have to be complex to be significant. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></li>      </ul>      <p><B>Principle 4: Provide a coherent and explicit chain of reasoning.</B>       </p>      <p><I>To what does this apply (e.g., the connections between question, evidence,         and conclusion; the connections between findings, implications, and applications)?</I>       </p>      <ul>        <li> A coherent and explicit chain of reasoning applies to everything           in the study. It begins with the purpose of the study and continues           through the selection of underlying theory, the initial assumptions           made, potential biases, the questions that are asked, the method and           its limits, the analysis of data, the interpretation of findings and           implications, and anything else we didn’t mention here. </li>        <li> The researcher is explicit about each of these and clearly explains           each. A key feature is the fidelity of carrying out the study as it           is aligned with the purpose, theory, etc. </li>      </ul>      <p><B>Principle 6: Disclose research to encourage professional scrutiny         and critique.</B> </p>      <p><I>How do ethics fit this principle? Does this principle adequately capture         the notion of the social construction of knowledge? Does this principle         entail explicitly stating all of the potential sources of bias involved         in conducting a scientific inquiry (e.g., political agendas, theoretical         camps, chains of reasoning, selection of methods, the sponsor’s charge         for the work)?</I> </p>      <ul>        <li> We suggest rewording the principle to “Encourage professional scrutiny           and critique throughout the process of research.” </li>        <li> By making the process open from the beginning, you will ensure a           higher standard of ethics. Peer review would also help identify sources           of bias. Peers might include stakeholders who are not professionals,           but who have an interest in the study, as well as those from alternative           theoretical perspectives. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a> </li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 4: You made a number of recommendations concerning how SEDL         should attend to scientific research, and the quality (or rigor) of it,         in our work.

One goal is to see <I>what works</I>, and how         to replicate that. Field-based T/TA providers need to report about success/problems         with implementation, as well as provide contextual details. T/TA staff         should provide information to help improve future training, based on context         and on-site activities. To do this, criteria for observing and reporting         are needed. </p>      <p><I>Is the T/TA that SEDL is currently providing based on research?</I>         <I> If SEDL staff train trainers and then observe that the training is         being implemented differently, does that mean the observation information         can’t be used?</I></p>      <p> If reported accurately, with contextual information, the results from         that observation can be used to add new information about the success         of the modified methods. NOTE: There is a difference in the TA provided         by REL and RTEC staff, for example. REL TA is more experimental than RTEC         TA. </p>      <p>To implement the scientific research principles, SEDL should develop         a definition of the role of training and technical assistance in research,         and of research in training and technical assistance. Contextual factors         are important and should be described.

The RTEC staff may have           important experiences to share regarding what they learned that could           inform the current work. There needs to be a mechanism/organizational           structure for sharing with each other. We would like cross-project efforts           to be encouraged at all levels of SEDL and for these efforts to be recognized           and rewarded (e.g., in performance appraisals) as important contributions           to SEDL and to our individual projects.

It would also be helpful to identify resources existing within           SEDL by creating a list of staff and their backgrounds as they relate           to research. For example, who has conducted ethnographic research? Who           has substantial experience and training with survey design?

In simple terms, the opposite of direct           investigation is a lousy research design. Direct investigation is most           likely to occur when people have been engaged in the research design           and have sought feedback on whether their methods permit the construct           of interest to be examined in an appropriate, valid, and reliable way.</li>      </ul>      <p><i>Do the constraints of resources (funding, time, people) impact the         selection of methods? If so, what do we say about those constraints?</i></p>      <ul>        <li> Yes. Because these constraints are part of the reality of research,           it is important to prioritize and decide which of these impacts are           and are not acceptable. We also had some discussion about how the constraints           of resources can impact the research as early as site selection. If           QA teams were set up to provide feedback at the stage of research design,           this would be a helpful mechanism to get feedback and to discuss the           bias that might be established by the fact that non-representative sites           or participants may be selected for research due to lack of resources           to reach other sites/participants. </li>        <li> Increased cross-project collaboration would allow SEDL staff to share           how they have to deal with different constraints. </li>      </ul>      <p><i>Under what circumstances can descriptive methods be counted as scientific?</i></p>      <ul>        <li> As long as descriptive (we assume this means qualitative) methods           are gathering relevant information for future confirmatory methods,           then they are contributing to the knowledge base in a meaningful way.         </li>        <li> We discussed the difference and importance of both exploratory and           confirmatory research. We also discussed stages of research and levels           of knowledge. It is important that researchers be aware of the stage           of the research. If little is known about a particular construct, it           may not only be appropriate, but necessary, to first conduct case studies           or other qualitative methods. Whether a method is scientific does not           have to do with whether it is qualitative versus quantitative; it has           to do with the extent to which the method is employed in a manner that           is systematic and replicable.</li>      </ul>      <p><i>Is there a continuum of the trustworthiness of evidence that is related         to the methods employed to gather it (e.g., from anecdotal to experimental         manipulation)? If so, what is it?</i></p>      <ul>        <li> Yes, we think there is a continuum of trustworthiness of evidence.           However, this can be seen as a developmental continuum wherein each           method is seen as equally valuable. For example, you often cannot reach           a stage of proven effectiveness without first observing anecdotal information.           One member of our group shared a table from the Edna McConnell Clark           Foundation related to the &#147;Continuum of Knowledge about Youth Development           Program Effectiveness,&#148; which categorizes the degree of &#147;trustworthiness&#148;           according to apparent effectiveness (justified assumption), demonstrated           effectiveness (substantial judgment), and proven effectiveness (scientific           knowledge). Apparent effectiveness involves systematic collection of           information, demonstrated effectiveness involves the use of comparison           groups, and proven effectiveness involves the use of random assignment           in an experimental design. While the use of random assignment may be           necessary before something is deemed as proven, other methods and studies           are often necessary before the resources for random assignment are granted.           In summary, we think a research design that employs comparison groups           and/or experimental manipulation produces data that are more trustworthy           than anecdotal comments. At the same time, we think that various forms           of knowledge (e.g., community knowledge, practical knowledge, knowledge           of personal interactions) are an important part of the process of deciding           exactly what to study in experimental design.</li>        <li> Integrity of the intervention and the willingness and ability of           a researcher to report on variables that may have impacted the intervention           are also seen as impacting the trustworthiness of data. If the &#147;intervention&#148;           and methods are not sound and explicit, then the conclusions based on           these data are not any more scientific that those produced through anecdotal           observations. </li>      </ul>      <p><b>Principle 5: Replicate and generalize across studies.</b></p>      <p><i>How does the notion of converging evidence relate to this principle?         What is the role of contextual factors in dealing with replication?</i></p>      <p>We ran out of time and did not answer any of the questions pertaining         to this principle.</p>      <p><b>Principle 6: Disclose research to encourage professional scrutiny         and critique</b></p>      <p><i>How do ethics fit this principle? Does this principle adequately capture         the notion of the social construction of knowledge? Does this principle         entail explicitly stating all of the potential sources of bias involved         in conducting a scientific inquiry (e.g., political agendas, theoretical         camps, chains of reasoning, selection of methods, the sponsor&#146;s charge         for the work)?</i></p>      <p>We did not specifically address any of the questions related to this         principle. However, some of our general recommendations (cross-project         collaboration, enhanced QA process, increased sharing and communication)         would facilitate professional scrutiny. <a href="#page_up"> [ UP ]</a></p>      <p><b>Question 4: You made a number of recommendations concerning how SEDL         should attend to scientific research, and the quality (or rigor) of it,         in our work. Select the three recommendations for how SEDL should attend         to scientific research that are deemed most critical by your group and         discuss what would have to be done to act on them (be specific and concrete).</b><br>        <br>        <i>Bullet 3: SEDL should review its current work to determine the extent         to which it is aligned with the principles of scientific research, including         our approach to working with schools and practitioners, and our current         research and evaluation projects. SEDL should take steps to bring its         work into alignment with these principles.</i></p>      <p> We did not have time to create specific plans for following this recommendation.       </p>      <p><i>Bullet 4: The quality assurance process should apply the principles         of scientific research in its review parameters, should become institution         wide, and should begin at the conception of projects.</i></p>      <p> To increase the quality of our work and our research methods, we would         like the opportunity to receive feedback from others regarding our research         questions and research design. We think that the QA process is a natural         mechanism for this, although we think it would be helpful to examine the         effectiveness and efficiency of the QA process, and to reorganize the         structure and scope of QA so that it would be possible to get feedback         at the conception of projects. Once the QA process has been examined and         improved, we would like the process to be institution wide. </p>      <p><i>Bullet 7: To increase staff understanding, SEDL should support an         ongoing dialogue between those who work primarily with assisting practitioners         and those who work primarily in conducting research. Ongoing professional         development should be provided in research methods and research practice,         with differing amounts of depths of professional development being provided         for staff depending on their individual roles at SEDL.</i></p>      <ul>        <li> There needs to be a connection and ongoing feedback loop between           fieldwork and research. This can be accomplished through creating more           opportunities for researchers to understand the perspective of the fieldwork           and for practitioners to learn how to approach their work as applied           researchers. There needs to be more explicit discussion between researchers           and practitioners about how their work can be integrated and reciprocally           informative.</li>        <li> There is a serious issue of isolation among site staff in the Task           1 work. For example, the small-group meetings for Task 1 staff are divided           by state, and since the small-group meetings are one of the main opportunities           for the Task 1 staff to share their work, this arrangement really precludes           sharing across many of the sites.</li>        <li> Need to train Task 1 site staff to think of themselves as researchers.           There needs to be more discussion to help clarify roles. Staff need           opportunities to discuss how to have the self-consciousness required           to take on different roles at different times. This is not easy to do.         </li>        <li> SEDL might benefit from a knowledge-management system that would           allow staff to easily use keywords to examine work done by SEDL staff.           However, before a knowledge-management system would be used, staff must           be motivated and have buy-in that they would benefit from knowing more           about others&#146; work. We think this buy-in and interest in looking           for knowledge could be built by providing structured mechanisms for           people to meet more frequently with one another to share challenges           and solutions/tips.</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Question 5: You listed a number of other types of knowledge that SEDL         needed to pay attention to as a producer and consumer of scientific research         (see Question 3).
