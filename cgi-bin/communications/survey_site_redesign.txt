Oct 12, 2005 12:48:27	Rhonda Stone	RhondaS@readright.com	Literature/Research Assistant to Dee Tadlock, Ph.D.	Several times a year	3	4	4	The variety of information	I'd love to see more discussion on alternative viewpoints	In 1996, SEDL published this discussion on constructivism:    http://www.sedl.org/pubs/sedletter/v09n03/resources.html    Would you consider publishing another article on this topic by Dee Tadlock, Ph.D., who has successfully applied constructivism to a highly effective reading intervention? Dr. Tadlock's methodology is most effective with what is supposed to be the toughest group of individuals to guide out of a reading problem -- teens, including teens who are special education students and/or living in poverty.  At more than 200 schools using her reading intervention last year, 2,683 students pre- and post-tested by school employees gained an average 8.6 NCEs for reading, more than double what is considered to be "meaningful" (Borman et al., 2003). Significantly, a total of 601 of those 2,683 students qualified for SPED. The average gain for all 601 SPED students using Dr. Tadlock's methodology and tested by school employees was 10.6 NCEs, more than triple what is considered to be meaningful.     In an article for you, Dee would share with your readers the idea that constructism is not properly understood, hence the reason that to date its benefits for students have been hit-and-miss. In July of this year, McGraw-Hill published Dee's first book, Read Right! Coaching Your Child to Excellence in Reading. This book explains in detail a strict constructivist view of reading and reading development. This first book was written in simple, clear language for families of young children. Dr. Tadlock has already been contacted about writing a second book for the academic community and she was nominated this year for the International Brock Prize in Education. Dr. Tadlock's view of what is required for excellent reading development is quite different from assumptions that drive the national reading agenda, and the view explains why popular reading theory continues to produce students whose reading ability degenerates as text complexity increases.     Our government now recognizes that two out of three students in Grades 6-12 are not proficient readers. It is time to consider that flaws in popular reading theory--not teachers, or students, or problems like poverty or low-literacy--are directly responsible for the continuing national crisis with reading.     Thank you for considering this,   Rhonda Stone  Literature/Research Assistant to Dee Tadlock, Ph.D.   rhondas@readright.com  360-427-9440	See "topics of interest"	Can we submit an article on constructivism for your consideration?
